Thioflavin\u2005T (ThT) emits an enhanced fluorescence signal when binding to G4 structures. Herein, we show that ThT can be competitively displaced by the binding of small molecules to G4 structures and develop a ThT-displacement high-throughput screening assay to find novel and selective G4-binding compounds. We screened approximately 28\u2009000 compounds by using three different G4 structures and identified eight novel G4 binders. Analysis of the structural conformation and stability of the G4 structures in presence of these compounds demonstrated that the four compounds enhance the thermal stabilization of the structures without affecting their structural conformation. In addition, all four compounds also increased the G4-structure block of DNA synthesis by Taq DNA polymerase. Also, two of these compounds showed selectivity between certain Schizosaccharomyces pombe G4 structures, thus suggesting that these compounds or their analogues can be used as selective tools for G4 DNA studies.", "doi": "10.1002/chem.201603463", "pmid": "27862378", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c1f37d688720468bba85733e96431889.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c1f37d688720468bba85733e96431889"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "484b585219f84ab08f68c6761e9e2ab0", "title": "Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Cancer Risk, Tumor Recurrence, or Survival of Head and Neck Cancer Patients.", "authors": [{"family": "Laytragoon-Lewin", "given": "Nongnit", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Cederblad", "given": "Lena", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Bengt-\u00c5ke", "initials": "B\u00c5"}, {"family": "Olin", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rutqvist", "given": "Lars Erik", "initials": "LE"}, {"family": "Lundgren", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Engstr\u00f6m", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Tytor", "given": "Wieslaw", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "L\u00f6fgren", "given": "Sture", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lewin", "given": "Freddi", "initials": "F"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-21", "journal": {"volume": "92", "issn": "1423-0232", "issue": "3", "pages": "161-169", "title": "Oncology"}, "abstract": "This paper aims at studying the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on cancer risk, tumor recurrence, and survival in head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer patients.\n\nA total of 45 SNPs in 41 genes were investigated.

A consensus view, currently, holds that LDs, which are weakly basic, diffuse across cellular membranes as monomers in an uncharged state, and via protonation in the acidic lysosomal compartment, they become trapped, accumulate, and subsequently solubilize the membrane and induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Here we demonstrate that the lysosomotropic detergent O-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride (MSDH) spontaneously assembles into vesicles at, and above, cytosolic pH, and that the vesicles disassemble as the pH reaches 6.4 or lower. The aggregation commences at concentrations below the range of those used in cell studies. Assembly and disassembly of the vesicles was studied via dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurements, cryo-TEM, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and was found to be reversible via control of the pH. Aggregation of MSDH into closed vesicles under cytosolic conditions is at variance with the commonly held view of LD behavior, and we propose that endocytotic pathways should be considered as possible routes of LD entry into lysosomes. We further demonstrate that MSDH vesicles can be loaded with fluorophores via a solution transition from low to high pH, for subsequent release when the pH is lowered again. The ability to encapsulate molecular cargo into MSDH vesicles together with its ability to disaggregate at low pH and to permeabilize the lysosomal membrane presents an intriguing possibility to use MSDH as a delivery system.", "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03458", "pmid": "27936755", "labels": {"Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/07e0aad42700478fbf4496f8b2c0521b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/07e0aad42700478fbf4496f8b2c0521b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3581eb151b9748d899ada9189de921c6", "title": "Production of individualized V gene databases reveals high levels of immunoglobulin genetic diversity.", "authors": [{"family": "Corcoran", "given": "Martin M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Phad", "given": "Ganesh E", "initials": "GE"}, {"family": "N\u00e9stor", "given": "V\u00e1zquez Bernat", "initials": "VB"}, {"family": "Stahl-Hennig", "given": "Christiane", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sumida", "given": "Noriyuki", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Mats A A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Martin", "given": "Marcel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Karlsson Hedestam", "given": "Gunilla B", "initials": "GB"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-20", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "2041-1723", "issue": null, "pages": "13642", "title": "Nat Commun"}, "abstract": "Comprehensive knowledge of immunoglobulin genetics is required to advance our understanding of B cell biology.

This motivated us to develop a theoretical-experimental framework for disclosing the presence of such adaptation-speeding mechanisms in an experimental evolution setting circumventing the need for pursuing costly mutation-accumulation experiments. To this end, we exposed clonal populations of budding yeast to a whole range of stressors. By growth phenotyping, we found that almost complete adaptation to arsenic emerged after a few mitotic cell divisions without involving any phenotypic plasticity. Causative mutations were identified by deep sequencing of the arsenic-adapted populations and reconstructed for validation. Mutation effects on growth phenotypes, and the associated mutational target sizes were quantified and embedded in data-driven individual-based evolutionary population models. We found that the experimentally observed homogeneity of adaptation speed and heterogeneity of molecular solutions could only be accounted for if the mutation rate had been near estimates of the basal mutation rate. The ultrafast adaptation could be fully explained by extensive positive pleiotropy such that all beneficial mutations dramatically enhanced multiple fitness components in concert.

We aimed to explore this and other genomic regions to identify genetic variants associated with the IgE responsiveness in humans. Forty-eight subjects from Cartagena, Colombia, with extreme values of specific IgE to Ascaris and ABA-1, a resistance marker of this nematode, were selected for targeted resequencing. Burden analyses were done comparing extreme groups for IgE values. One-hundred one SNPs were genotyped in 1258 individuals of two well-characterized populations from Colombia and Sweden. Two low-frequency coding variants in the gene encoding the Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (CHIA rs79500525, rs139812869, tagged by rs10494133) were found enriched in high IgE responders to ABA-1 and confirmed by genetic association analyses. The SNP rs4950928 in the Chitinase 3 Like 1 gene (CHI3L1) was associated with high IgE to ABA-1 in Colombians and with high IgE to Bet v 1 in the Swedish population. CHIA rs10494133 and ABDH13 rs3783118 were associated with IgE responses to Ascaris. SNPs in the Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily Member 13b gene (TNFSF13B) encoding the cytokine B cell activating Factor were associated with high levels of total IgE in both populations. This is the first report on the association between low-frequency and common variants in the chitinases-related genes CHIA and CHI3L1 with the intensity of specific IgE to ABA-1 in a population naturally exposed to Ascaris and with Bet v 1 in a Swedish population. Our results add new information about the genetic influences of human IgE responsiveness; since the genes encode for enzymes involved in the immune response to parasitic infections, they could be helpful for understanding helminth immunity and allergic responses. We also confirmed that TNFSF13B has an important and conserved role in the regulation of total IgE levels, which supports potential evolutionary links between helminth immunity and allergic response.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0167453", "pmid": "27977724", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-16-33646"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5157985"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a965f00cd08e43a19a3edd336da2cc19.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a965f00cd08e43a19a3edd336da2cc19"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d33eb283488241759ee9c4d96ce3fea5", "title": "Transposon Mutagenesis Reveals Fludarabine Resistance Mechanisms in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.", "authors": [{"family": "Pandzic", "given": "Tatjana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Jimmy", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "He", "given": "Liqun", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kundu", "given": "Snehangshu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ban", "given": "Kenneth", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Akhtar-Ali", "given": "Muhammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anders R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Schuh", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Clifford", "given": "Ruth", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Blakemore", "given": "Stuart J", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Strefford", "given": "Jonathan C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Baumann", "given": "Tycho", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lopez-Guillermo", "given": "Armando", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Campo", "given": "Elias", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ljungstr\u00f6m", "given": "Viktor", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Mansouri", "given": "Larry", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rosenquist", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6blom", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-15", "journal": {"volume": "22", "issn": "1078-0432", "issue": "24", "pages": "6217-6227", "title": "Clin.

One of the identified genes is a known resistance mediator DCK (deoxycytidine kinase), which encodes an enzyme that is essential for the phosphorylation of the prodrug to the active metabolite. BMP2K, a gene not previously linked to CLL, was also identified as a modulator of response to fludarabine. In addition, 10 of 782 transposon-targeted genes had previously been implicated in treatment resistance based on somatic mutations seen in patients refractory to fludarabine-based therapy. Functional characterization of these genes supported a significant role for ARID5B and BRAF in fludarabine sensitivity. Finally, pathway analysis of transposon-targeted genes and RNA-seq profiling of fludarabine-resistant cells suggested deregulated MAPK signaling as involved in mediating drug resistance in CLL.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first forward genetic screen for chemotherapy resistance in CLL. The screen pinpointed novel genes and pathways involved in fludarabine resistance along with previously known resistance mechanisms. Transposon screens can therefore aid interpretation of cancer genome sequencing data in the identification of genes modifying sensitivity to chemotherapy.

We observed that, despite its location on the PAR that predicts equal dosage across genders, PPP2R3B expression was lower in males than in females and was independently correlated with poor clinical outcome. PPP2R3B codes for the PR70 protein, a regulatory substrate-recognizing subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. PR70 decreased melanoma growth by negatively interfering with DNA replication and cell cycle progression through its role in stabilizing the cell division cycle 6 (CDC6)-chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) interaction, which delays the firing of origins of DNA replication.

Several previous studies have attempted to confirm this but results remain inconclusive. We expand on previous studies by including more RA risk alleles, and maximize power by combining them into a genetic risk score.\n\nWe linked genotyped RA patients from the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis study to the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register, identifying patients who started a TNFi as their first biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, with a return visit within 2-8 months after treatment start (N\u2009=\u2009867).

A method referred to as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), implemented on Orbitrap MS, has lately been presented as an excellent alternative to more traditional selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) methods. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-system is not well described in the cat but there are indications of important differences between cats and humans. In feline medicine IGF-I is mainly analyzed for diagnosis of growth hormone disorders but also for research, while the other proteins in the IGF-system are not routinely analyzed within clinical practice. Here, a PRM method for quantification of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein (BP) -3 and IGFBP-5 in feline serum is presented. Selective quantification was supported by the use of a newly launched internal standard named QPrEST\u2122. Homology searches demonstrated the possibility to use this standard of human origin for quantification of the targeted feline proteins. Excellent quantitative sensitivity at the attomol/\u03bcL (pM) level and selectivity were obtained.

A critical question still unanswered is if selection pressures within STPs, caused by residual antibiotics or other co-selective agents, are sufficient to specifically promote resistance. To address this, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples from different steps of the treatment process in three Swedish STPs. In parallel, concentrations of selected antibiotics, biocides and metals were analyzed. We found that concentrations of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin in the influent were above predicted concentrations for resistance selection, however, there was no consistent enrichment of resistance genes to any particular class of antibiotics in the STPs, neither for biocide and metal resistance genes. The most substantial change of the bacterial communities compared to human feces occurred already in the sewage pipes, manifested by a strong shift from obligate to facultative anaerobes. Through the treatment process, resistance genes against antibiotics, biocides and metals were not reduced to the same extent as fecal bacteria. The OXA-48 gene was consistently enriched in surplus and digested sludge. We find this worrying as OXA-48, still rare in Swedish clinical isolates, provides resistance to carbapenems, one of our most critically important classes of antibiotics.

The aim is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses.

The identities of such trophic links are not easily estimated as spiders, a dominant group of shoreline predator, have external digestion. We compared trophic links and the prey diversity of spiders on different shore types along the Baltic Sea: on open shores and on shores with a reed belt bordering the water. A priori, we hypothesized that the physical structure of the shoreline reduces the flow between ecosystem and the subsidies across the sea-land interface. To circumvent the lack of morphologically detectable remains of spider prey, we used a combination of stable isotope and molecular gut content analyses. The two tools used for diet analysis revealed complementary information on spider diets. The stable isotope analysis indicated that spiders on open shores had a marine signal of carbon isotopes, while spiders on reedy shores had a terrestrial signal. The molecular analysis revealed a diverse array of dipteran and lepidopteran prey, where spiders on open and reedy shores shared a similar diet with a comparable proportion of chironomids, the larvae of which live in the marine system. Comparing the methods suggests that differences in isotope composition of the two spider groups occurred because of differences in the chironomid diets: as larvae, chironomids of reedy shores likely fed on terrestrial detritus and acquired a terrestrial isotope signature, while chironomids of open shores utilized an algal diet and acquired a marine isotope signature. Our results illustrate how different methods of diet reconstruction may shed light on complementary aspects of nutrient transfer. Overall, they reveal that reed belts can reduce connectivity between habitats, but also function as a source of food for predators.", "doi": "10.1002/ece3.2536", "pmid": "28031795", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ECE32536"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5167037"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/17d3f0529e1043fb8ddc82759f401c5f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/17d3f0529e1043fb8ddc82759f401c5f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1ff4fa0ec02e4a5bbf09d435e6a0f0da", "title": "Using 2D NMR to characterize the structure of the low and high molecular weight fractions of bio-oil obtained from LignoBoost\u2122 kraft lignin depolymerized in subcritical water", "authors": [{"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Sven Ingvar", "initials": "SI"}, {"family": "Belkheiri", "given": "Tallal", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "\u00c5mand", "given": "Lars Erik", "initials": "LE"}, {"family": "Olausson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Vamling", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Theliander", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "95", "issn": "0961-9534", "issue": null, "pages": "364-377", "title": "Biomass and Bioenergy"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.09.004", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1ff4fa0ec02e4a5bbf09d435e6a0f0da.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1ff4fa0ec02e4a5bbf09d435e6a0f0da"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "20b5ce2806f846e2981fdd6e38297cc4", "title": "Regulation of amino-acid metabolism controls flux to lipid accumulation in Yarrowia lipolytica", "authors": [{"family": "Kerkhoven", "given": "Eduard J", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Pomraning", "given": "Kyle R", "initials": "KR"}, {"family": "Baker", "given": "Scott E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "2", "issn": "2056-7189", "issue": "1", "pages": null, "title": "npj Syst Biol Appl"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/npjsba.2016.5", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/20b5ce2806f846e2981fdd6e38297cc4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/20b5ce2806f846e2981fdd6e38297cc4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "272174e30f92414ba799135f556051ef", "title": "Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence.", "authors": [{"family": "Chrobok", "given": "Daria", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Law", "given": "Simon R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Brouwer", "given": "Bastiaan", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lind\u00e9n", "given": "Pernilla", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ziolkowska", "given": "Agnieszka", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Liebsch", "given": "Daniela", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Narsai", "given": "Reena", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Szal", "given": "Bozena", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Moritz", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Rouhier", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Whelan", "given": "James", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Gardestr\u00f6m", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Keech", "given": "Olivier", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "172", "issn": "1532-2548", "issue": "4", "pages": "2132-2153", "title": "Plant Physiol."}, "abstract": "The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is conserved until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a metabolomic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial metabolism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both amino acids and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. Glutamate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic glutamine synthase, is likely to become a metabolically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain amino acid and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin metabolism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and metabolic hubs.", "doi": "10.1104/pp.16.01463", "pmid": "27744300", "labels": {"Swedish Metabolomics Centre (SMC)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "pp.16.01463"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5129728"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/272174e30f92414ba799135f556051ef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/272174e30f92414ba799135f556051ef"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4d24e6c3e9964c54b9ac5031bb376794", "title": "Extended exome sequencing identifies BACH2 as a novel major risk locus for Addison's disease.", "authors": [{"family": "Eriksson", "given": "D", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Bianchi", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "N", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nordin", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Dalin", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mathioudaki", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "G N", "initials": "GN"}, {"family": "Hultin-Rosenberg", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Dahlqvist", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Zetterqvist", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "\u00c5", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Hallgren", "given": "\u00c5", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Farias", "given": "F H G", "initials": "FH"}, {"family": "Mur\u00e9n", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ahlgren", "given": "K M", "initials": "KM"}, {"family": "Lobell", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Tandre", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dahlqvist", "given": "S R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derkvist", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnblom", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hulting", "given": "A-L", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Wahlberg", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ekwall", "given": "O", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Dahlqvist", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Meadows", "given": "J R S", "initials": "JR"}, {"family": "Bensing", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lindblad-Toh", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "K\u00e4mpe", "given": "O", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Pielberg", "given": "G R", "initials": "GR"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "280", "issn": "1365-2796", "issue": "6", "pages": "595-608", "title": "J.

In total, 441 human samples of ventricular CSF collected post mortem and lumbar CSF collected ante mortem are analyzed using 376 antibodies in a suspension bead array setup, utilizing a direct labelling approach.\n\nAmong several proteins displaying differentiated profiles between sample groups, we focus here on two synaptic proteins, neuromodulin (GAP43) and neurogranin (NRGN). They are both found at elevated levels in CSF from AD patients in two independent cohorts, providing disease-associated profiles in addition to verifying and strengthening previously observed patterns. Increased levels are also observed for patients for whom the AD diagnosis was not established at the time of sampling.\n\nThese findings indicate that analyzing the brain-enriched proteins in CSF is of particular interest to increase the understanding of the CSF proteome and its relation to neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, this study lends support to the notion that measurements of these synaptic proteins could potentially be of great relevance in future diagnostic tests for AD.", "doi": "10.1002/prca.201500150", "pmid": "27604409", "labels": {"Fluorescence Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative", "Plasma Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5157753"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7362064a1f044c14a2e50a26392e171a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7362064a1f044c14a2e50a26392e171a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "79f9470c7f03483f9ecb1a5d6a7dd093", "title": "Early Perspective", "authors": [{"family": "Seashore-Ludlow", "given": "Brinton", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lundb\u00e4ck", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "21", "issn": "1552-454X", "issue": "10", "pages": "1019-1033", "title": "J Biomol Screen"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1177/1087057116659256", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/79f9470c7f03483f9ecb1a5d6a7dd093.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/79f9470c7f03483f9ecb1a5d6a7dd093"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "943139d0335a490794e3bf5bb419e4ce", "title": "The disappearing San of southeastern Africa and their genetic affinities.", "authors": [{"family": "Schlebusch", "given": "Carina M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Prins", "given": "Frans", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Lombard", "given": "Marlize", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jakobsson", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Soodyall", "given": "Himla", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "135", "issn": "1432-1203", "issue": "12", "pages": "1365-1373", "title": "Hum.

Around that time, East African groups assimilated with local San groups and gave rise to the Khoekhoe herders. Subsequently, Bantu-speaking farmers, arriving from the north (~1800\u00a0years ago), assimilated and displaced San and Khoekhoe groups, a process that intensified with the arrival of European colonists ~350\u00a0years ago. In contrast to the western parts of southern Africa, where several Khoe-San groups still live today, the eastern parts are largely populated by Bantu speakers and individuals of non-African descent. Only a few scattered groups with oral traditions of Khoe-San ancestry remain. Advances in genetic research open up new ways to understand the population history of southeastern Africa. We investigate the genomic variation of the remaining individuals from two South African groups with oral histories connecting them to eastern San groups, i.e., the San from Lake Chrissie and the Duma San of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg. Using ~2.2 million genetic markers, combined with comparative published data sets, we show that the Lake Chrissie San have genetic ancestry from both Khoe-San (likely the ||Xegwi San) and Bantu speakers. Specifically, we found that the Lake Chrissie San are closely related to the current southern San groups (i.e., the Karretjie people). Duma San individuals, on the other hand, were genetically similar to southeastern Bantu speakers from South Africa. This study illustrates how genetic tools can be used to assess hypotheses about the ancestry of people who seemingly lost their historic roots, only recalling a vague oral tradition of their origin.",

It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (\u03c1genetic = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling.

Several studies have focused on marine environments, with less exploration of rhodopsins in brackish waters. We investigated microbial rhodopsins in the Baltic Sea using size-fractionated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets collected along a salinity gradient spanning from \u223c0 to 35 PSU. The normalised genomic abundance of rhodopsins in Bacteria, as well as rhodopsin gene expression, was highest in the smallest size fraction (0.1-0.8 \u03bcm), relative to the medium (0.8-3.0 \u03bcm) and large (>3.0 \u03bcm) size fractions. The abundance of rhodopsins in the two smaller size fractions displayed a positive correlation with salinity. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes rhodopsins were the most abundant while Actinobacteria rhodopsins, or actinorhodopsins, were common at lower salinities. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that rhodopsins have adapted independently to the marine-brackish transition on multiple occasions, giving rise to green light-adapted variants from ancestral blue light-adapted ones. A notable diversity of viral-like rhodopsins was also detected in the dataset and potentially linked with eukaryotic phytoplankton blooms. Finally, a new clade of likely proton-pumping rhodopsin with non-canonical amino acids in the spectral tuning and proton accepting site was identified.", "doi": "10.1111/1462-2920.13407", "pmid": "27306515", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a24e7ebb50c9439b8b7038899c4d1657.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a24e7ebb50c9439b8b7038899c4d1657"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a94d98b34bdd4bdf93dfda75060b5e8a", "title": "Identification of Shared and Unique Serum Lipid Profiles in Diabetes Mellitus and Myocardial Infarction", "authors": [{"family": "Kjellqvist", "given": "Sanela", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Klose", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Surma", "given": "Michal A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Hindy", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mollet", "given": "In\u00eas G", "initials": "IG"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Chavaux", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Gottfries", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Simons", "given": "Kai", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Melander", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Fernandez", "given": "C\u00e9line", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2047-9980", "issue": "12", "pages": "e004503", "title": "J Am Heart Assoc"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1161/jaha.116.004503", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Collaborative", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a94d98b34bdd4bdf93dfda75060b5e8a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a94d98b34bdd4bdf93dfda75060b5e8a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d7d7ca0a659742c58af9a9b5a57722a3", "title": "Application of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry for epitope mapping in human cystatin C.", "authors": [{"family": "Pr\u0105dzi\u0144ska", "given": "Martyna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Behrendt", "given": "Izabela", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Astorga-Wells", "given": "Juan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Manoilov", "given": "Aleksandr", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zubarev", "given": "Roman A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Ko\u0142odziejczyk", "given": "Aleksandra S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Rodziewicz-Motowid\u0142o", "given": "Sylwia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Czaplewska", "given": "Paulina", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "48", "issn": "1438-2199", "issue": "12", "pages": "2809-2820", "title": "Amino Acids"}, "abstract": "Human cystatin C (hCC) is a small cysteine protease inhibitor whose oligomerization by propagated domain swapping is linked to certain neurological disorders.

This process of historical biodiversity loss has particularly affected tropical island regions such as the Caribbean, an area of great evolutionary diversification but poor molecular preservation. The most enigmatic of the recently extinct endemic Caribbean mammals are the Nesophontidae, a family of morphologically plesiomorphic lipotyphlan insectivores with no consensus on their evolutionary affinities, and which constitute the only major recent mammal clade to lack any molecular information on their phylogenetic placement. Here, we use a palaeogenomic approach to place Nesophontidae within the phylogeny of recent Lipotyphla. We recovered the near-complete mitochondrial genome and sequences for 17 nuclear genes from a \u223c750-year-old Hispaniolan Nesophontes specimen, and identify a divergence from their closest living relatives, the Solenodontidae, more than 40 million years ago.

Chemotaxonomic data supported the allocation of the strain to the family Thorselliaceae. The major fatty acids were C18\u2009:\u20091\u03c97c, C16\u2009:\u20090 and C14\u2009:\u20090. The quinone system was composed of ubiquinones Q-8 and Q-7 (1\u2009:\u20090.3), the predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, and the polyamine pattern showed the major compound putrescine. However, qualitative and quantitative differences in the major polyamine, polar lipid profile and fatty acid patterns distinguished strain Braz8T from species of the genus Thorsellia. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, average nucleotide identity, DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus sequence analysis as well as physiological and biochemical tests distinguished strain Braz8T both genotypically and phenotypically from the three Thorsellia species but also showed its placement in the family Thorselliaceae. Thus, strain Braz8T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus most closely related to the genus Thorsellia, for which the name Coetzeea brasiliensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

Stx production is a key virulence factor associated with the pathogenicity of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and can result in the development of haemolytic uremic syndrome in infected patients. The genes encoding Stx are located on temperate lysogenic phages integrated into the bacterial chromosome and expression of the toxin is generally coupled to phage induction through the SOS response. We aimed to find new compounds capable of blocking expression of Stx type 2 (Stx2) as this subtype of Stx is more strongly associated with human disease. High-throughput screening of a small-molecule library identified a lead compound that reduced Stx2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. We show that the optimized compound interferes with the SOS response by directly affecting the activity and oligomerization of RecA, thus limiting phage activation and Stx2 expression. Our work suggests that RecA is highly susceptible to inhibition and that targeting this protein is a viable approach to limiting production of Stx2 by EHEC. This type of approach has the potential to limit production and transfer of other phage induced and transduced determinants.", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2016.01930", "pmid": "27965652", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5127787"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2a84a04fc8ac43a98094ccaac1ecedac.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2a84a04fc8ac43a98094ccaac1ecedac"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3a045551497a4249a329c009e8e8d959", "title": "A stromal cell population in the large intestine identified by tissue factor expression that is lost during colorectal cancer progression.", "authors": [{"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Oskar", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Asplund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hegde", "given": "Geeta", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Edqvist", "given": "Per-Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Navani", "given": "Sanjay", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Siegbahn", "given": "Agneta", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-11-30", "journal": {"volume": "116", "issn": "0340-6245", "issue": "6", "pages": "1050-1059", "title": "Thromb.

Tissue factor (TF) functions as the trigger of haemostasis together with its ligand coagulation factor VII/VIIa, and TF expression has been found in tumour cells of colorectal tumours. However, TF expression in the CRC tumour stroma or its relationship to patient outcome has not yet been studied. To address this question we developed and validated a specific anti-TF antibody using standardised methods within the Human Protein Atlas project. We used this antibody to investigate TF expression in normal colorectal tissue and CRC using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in two patient cohorts. TF was strongly expressed in a cell population immediately adjacent to the colorectal epithelium. These TF-positive cells were ACTA2-negative but weakly vimentin-positive, defining a specific population of pericryptal sheath cells. In colorectal tumours, TF-positive sheath cells were progressively lost after the adenoma-to-carcinoma transition, demonstrating downregulation of this source of TF in CRC. Furthermore, loss of sheath cell TF was significantly associated with poor overall and disease-specific survival in rectal but not colon cancers. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TF is a marker of a specific cell population in the large intestine, which is lost during CRC progression.

Studies relating differential methylation with intermediate phenotypes and disease endpoints may be useful in identifying additional candidate genes and mechanisms involved in disease.\n\nTo investigate the role of epigenetic variation in oxidative stress marker levels and subsequent development of CVD and T2D, we performed analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation in blood, ten markers of oxidative stress (total glutathione [TGSH], reduced glutathione [GSH], oxidised glutathione [GSSG], GSSG to GSH ratio, homocysteine [HCY], oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), antibodies against oxLDL [OLAB], conjugated dienes [CD], baseline conjugated dienes [BCD]-LDL and total antioxidant capacity [TAOC]) and incident disease in up to 966 age-matched individuals.\n\nIn total, we found 66 cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites associated with one or more oxidative stress markers (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). These sites were enriched in regulatory regions of the genome. Genes annotated to CpG sites showed enrichment in annotation clusters relating to phospho-metabolism and proteins with pleckstrin domains. We investigated the contribution of oxidative stress-associated CpGs to development of cardiometabolic disease. Methylation variation at CpGs in the 3'-UTR of HIST1H4D (cg08170869; histone cluster 1, H4d) and in the body of DVL1 (cg03465880; dishevelled-1) were associated with incident T2D events during 10\u00a0years of follow-up (all permutation p-values <0.01), indicating a role of epigenetic regulation in oxidative stress processes leading to development or progression of diabetes. Methylation QTL (meQTL) analysis showed significant associations with genetic sequence variants in cis at 28 (42%) of oxidative stress phenotype-associated sites (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Integrating cis-meQTLs with genotype-phenotype associations indicated that genetic effects on oxidative stress phenotype at one locus (cg07547695; BCL2L11) may be mediated through DNA methylation.\n\nIn conclusion, we report novel associations of DNA methylation with oxidative stress, some of which also show evidence of a relation with T2D incidence.", "doi": "10.1186/s12920-016-0235-0", "pmid": "27884142", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12920-016-0235-0"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5123374"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/89ba79c4994045089043812f31525e65.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/89ba79c4994045089043812f31525e65"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9dcf6f5308fa4f2da723f73fd428d53a", "title": "Towards agile large-scale predictive modelling in drug discovery with flow-based programming design principles.", "authors": [{"family": "Lampa", "given": "Samuel", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Alvarsson", "given": "Jonathan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Spjuth", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-11-24", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1758-2946", "issue": null, "pages": "67", "title": "J Cheminform"}, "abstract": "Predictive modelling in drug discovery is challenging to automate as it often contains multiple analysis steps and might involve cross-validation and parameter tuning that create complex dependencies between tasks.

Bacterial community composition in brackish vs. marine conditions, and in July vs. February was significantly different.

Bark beetle phenology was studied in two sites: a seed orchard of P. abies and a plantation of Picea pungens (Engelm.). D. micans morphology was assessed under the dissection microscope using individuals at different developmental stages that were sampled during phenology observations. Communities of fungi associated with D. micans were studied using both fungal culturing methods and direct high-throughput sequencing from D. micans. Results showed that the incidence D. micans was relatively rare and D. micans was mainly detected in central and eastern Lithuania. The life cycle included the following stages: adult, egg, I-V developmental stage larvae and pupa. However, development of D. micans was quicker and its nests larger under the bark of P. pungens than of P. abies, indicating the effect of the host species. Fungal culturing and direct high-throughput sequencing revealed that D. micans associated fungi communities were species rich and dominated by yeasts from a class Saccharomycetes.

In this study, we find that EGF stimulation specifically increases the transport efficiency of newly synthesized EGFRs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This coincides with an up-regulation of the inner coat protein complex II (COPII) components SEC23B, SEC24B, and SEC24D, which we show to be specifically required for EGFR transport. Up-regulation of these COPII components requires the transcriptional regulator RNF11, which localizes to early endosomes and appears additionally in the cell nucleus upon continuous EGF stimulation.

Multivariable analysis showed that the association between ANLN and survival was significantly independent of age in cohort I and significantly independent of proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 expression in tumor cells, age, tumor size, ER and PR status, HER2 status and nodal status in cohort II. Analysis of ANLN mRNA expression confirmed that high expression of ANLN was significantly correlated to poor overall survival in breast cancer patients. Consistent with the role of ANLN during cytokinesis, transient knock-down of ANLN protein expression in breast cancer cell lines resulted in an increase of senescent cells and an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle with altered cell morphology including large, poly-nucleated cells. Moreover, ANLN siRNA knockdown also resulted in decreased expression of cyclins D1, A2 and B1.\n\nANLN expression in breast cancer cells plays an important role during cell division and a high fraction of nuclear ANLN expression in tumor cells is correlated to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, independent of Ki-67, tumor size, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, nodal status and age.", "doi": "10.1186/s12885-016-2923-8", "pmid": "27863473", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12885-016-2923-8"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5116155"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/508c656babda482a96344a438394dbd5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/508c656babda482a96344a438394dbd5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "040426aff24d45dda3575ef1c359e10f", "title": "Complete Genome Sequence of an African Swine Fever Virus Isolate from Sardinia, Italy.", "authors": [{"family": "Granberg", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Torresi", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Oggiano", "given": "Annalisa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Maja", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Iscaro", "given": "Carmen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "De Mia", "given": "Gian Mario", "initials": "GM"}, {"family": "Bel\u00e1k", "given": "S\u00e1ndor", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-11-17", "journal": {"volume": "4", "issn": "2169-8287", "issue": "6", "title": "Genome Announc"}, "abstract": "Previous genetic characterization of African swine fever virus isolates from the Italian island of Sardinia, where the virus has been present since 1978, has largely been limited to a few selected genomic regions.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may provide novel biomarkers of alcohol use. To examine this possibility, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in relation to alcohol intake in 13 population-based cohorts (ntotal=13\u2009317; 54% women; mean age across cohorts 42-76 years) using whole blood (9643 European and 2423 African ancestries) or monocyte-derived DNA (588 European, 263 African and 400 Hispanic ancestry) samples. We performed meta-analysis and variable selection in whole-blood samples of people of European ancestry (n=6926) and identified 144 CpGs that provided substantial discrimination (area under the curve=0.90-0.99) for current heavy alcohol intake (\u2a7e42\u2009g per day in men and \u2a7e28\u2009g per day in women) in four replication cohorts. The ancestry-stratified meta-analysis in whole blood identified 328 (9643 European ancestry samples) and 165 (2423 African ancestry samples) alcohol-related CpGs at Bonferroni-adjusted P<1 \u00d7 10(-7). Analysis of the monocyte-derived DNA (n=1251) identified 62 alcohol-related CpGs at P<1 \u00d7 10(-7). In whole-blood samples of people of European ancestry, we detected differential methylation in two neurotransmitter receptor genes, the \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid-A receptor delta and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid B receptor subunit 1; their differential methylation was associated with expression levels of a number of genes involved in immune function. In conclusion, we have identified a robust alcohol-related DNA methylation signature and shown the potential utility of DNA methylation as a clinically useful diagnostic test to detect current heavy alcohol consumption.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 15 November 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.192.", "doi": "10.1038/mp.2016.192", "pmid": "27843151", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mp2016192"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/775f25e7409f4ccdacd52bc658116f4f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/775f25e7409f4ccdacd52bc658116f4f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d0e408da94d748e285fcfd92374ae52f", "title": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Structure and Mutational Analysis of the Lactococcin A Immunity Protein.", "authors": [{"family": "Kristiansen", "given": "Per Eugen", "initials": "PE"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fuochi", "given": "Virginia", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "G\u00f6ran B", "initials": "GB"}, {"family": "Nissen-Meyer", "given": "Jon", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Oppeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-11-15", "journal": {"volume": "55", "issn": "1520-4995", "issue": "45", "pages": "6250-6257", "title": "Biochemistry"}, "abstract": "The class IId bacteriocin lactococcin A and the pediocin-like bacteriocins induce membrane leakage and cell death by specifically binding the mannose phophotransferase system (man-PTS) on their target cells.

Urothelial cells presented a general repression of genes required for cell cycle progression and upregulation of growth-inhibitory genes, as well as a decrease in deoxyribose nucleic acid replication after long-term culture. Molecules were identified with a potential to regulate human urothelial cell senescence, such as the micro-ribonucleic acid Let-7. Human urothelial cells did not acquire copy number variations after long-term culture and the cells had a normal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Altogether, both gene expression studies and array comparative genomic hybridization indicated a good quality of in vitro propagated cells.

For this purpose, we analyzed protein expression in tissue microarrays of tumor samples stratified by patient age and IDH mutation status. We initially screened 86 unselected high-grade astrocytomas, followed by 174 IDH1-R132H1 immunonegative glioblastomas derived from patients aged 60 years and older enrolled in the Nordic phase III trial of elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

In contrast, high expression of PROX1 protein predicted shorter survival in the group of patients with IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas. The prognostic impact of PROX1 in IDH-mutant 1p19q non-codeleted high-grade astrocytomas, as well as the negative findings in primary glioblastomas, was corroborated by gene expression data extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas.

TOR inactivation resulted in a coordinated down-regulation of the transcription and translation of nuclear-encoded mRNAs coding for plastidic ribosomal proteins, which could explain the chlorotic phenotype of the TOR silenced plants. We have identified in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of this set of genes a conserved sequence related to the 5' terminal oligopyrimidine motif, which is known to confer translational regulation by the TOR kinase in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the phosphoproteomic analysis of the ribosomal fraction following TOR inactivation revealed a lower phosphorylation of the conserved Ser240 residue in the C-terminal region of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser240 in RPS6. Finally, this antibody was used to follow TOR activity in plants.

In this work, we present characteristics of natural anti-hCC antibodies isolated from the IgG fraction of human serum by affinity chromatography.

However, significant association was seen for rs893051 in patients who developed AD before the age of 5 years (P < 0.03).\n\nTaken together, we demonstrate that tight junction genes and, in

Growing evidence underlines a pathogenic contribution of sterile postinjury inflammation in APAP-induced acute liver injury (APAP-ALI) and justifies development of anti-inflammatory therapies with therapeutic efficacy beyond the therapeutic window of the only current treatment option, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The inflammatory mediator, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), is a key regulator of a range of liver injury conditions and is elevated in clinical and preclinical APAP-ALI. The anti-HMGB1 antibody (m2G7) is therapeutically beneficial in multiple inflammatory conditions, and anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody treatment improves survival in a model of APAP-ALI. Herein, we developed and investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a partly humanized anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb; h2G7) and identified its mechanism of action in preclinical APAP-ALI. The mouse anti-HMGB1 mAb (m2G7) was partly humanized (h2G7) by merging variable domains of m2G7 with human antibody-Fc backbones. Effector function-deficient variants of h2G7 were assessed in comparison with h2G7 in vitro and in preclinical APAP-ALI. h2G7 retained identical antigen specificity and comparable affinity as m2G7. 2G7 treatments significantly attenuated APAP-induced serum elevations of alanine aminotransferase and microRNA-122 and completely abrogated markers of APAP-induced inflammation (tumor necrosis factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 1) with prolonged therapeutic efficacy as compared to NAC.

The therapeutic effect was mediated by HMGB1 neutralization and attenuation of postinjury inflammation.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether stimulation with different TLR ligands induces the kynurenine pathway in human peripheral monocytes. Cell supernatants were analysed using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to measure kynurenine, kynurenic acid (KYNA), quinolinic acid (QUIN) and tryptophan. Stimulation of TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-7/8 and TLR-9 was found to induce the production of kynurenine, but only stimulation of TLR-3 increased levels of further downstream metabolites, such as KYNA and QUIN. Stimulation of TLR-1, TLR-5 and TLR-6 did not induce the kynurenine pathway. Taken together, this study provides novel evidence demonstrating that TLR activation induces a pattern of downstream tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway in monocytes.

We showed for the first time that hypomethylation of IFN-regulated genes in pSS B cells was associated with their increased expression.

We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by E/R genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). We show that expression of the E/R fusion leads to widespread repression of RUNX1 motif-containing enhancers at its target gene loci. Moreover, multiple super-enhancers from the CD19(+)/CD20(+)-lineage were repressed, implicating a role in impediment of lineage commitment. In effect, the expression of several genes involved in B cell signaling and adhesion was down-regulated, and the repression depended on the wild-type DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1.

Therefore, a comprehensive resource of synaptic brain RTCs is still lacking. In particular, studies on the detergent-soluble synaptosomal fraction, known to contain transporters and channels, are limited. We, therefore, performed sub-synaptosomal fractionation of rat cerebral cortex, followed by trypsin/chymotrypsin sequential digestion of a detergent-soluble synaptosomal fraction and a postsynaptic density preparation, stable-isotope tryptic peptide labeling and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Based on the current study, a total of 4784 synaptic proteins were submitted to the ProteomExchange database (PXD001948), including 274 receptors, 394 transporters/channels and 1377 transmembrane proteins. Function-based classification assigned 1781 proteins as probable drug targets with 834 directly linked to brain disorders. The analytical approach identified 499 RTCs that are not listed in the largest, curated database for synaptosomal proteins (SynProt).

With the aim of studying the presence of tumor cells outside the radiological border, the authors developed a method of correlating MRI findings with histological data in patients with suspected DLGGs in whom en bloc resections were performed. METHODS Five patients with suspected DLGG suitable for en bloc resection were recruited from an ongoing prospective study. Sections of the entire tumor were immunostained with antibodies against mutated IDH1 protein (IDH1-R132H). Magnetic resonance images were coregistered with corresponding IDH1 images. The growth pattern of tumor cells in white and gray matter was assessed in comparison with signal changes on corresponding MRI slices. RESULTS Neuropathological assessment revealed DLGG in 4 patients and progression to WHO Grade III glioma in 1 patient. The tumor core consisted of a high density of IDH1-R132H-positive tumor cells and was located in both gray and white matter. Tumor cells infiltrated along the peripheral fibers of the white matter tracts. In all cases, tumor cells were found outside the radiological tumor border delineated on T2-FLAIR MRI sequences. CONCLUSIONS The authors present a new method for the coregistration of histological and radiological characteristics of en bloc-removed infiltrative brain tumors that discloses tumor invasion at the radiological tumor borders. This technique can be applied to evaluate the sensitivity of alternative imaging methods to detect scattered tumor cells at tumor borders. Accurate methods for detection of infiltrative tumor cells will improve the possibility of performing radical tumor resection.

In a pilot data set including 77 glioma patients, we used Illumina beadchip technology to analyze genetic variants in blood and DNA methylation in matched tumor samples. To validate our findings, we used data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, including 401 glioblastoma patients. Consensus clustering identified the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (gCIMP) and two additional subgroups with distinct patterns of global DNA methylation.

We combined proteomics, RNA analyses, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy to identify molecular differences in samples of non-dilated ascending aortas from BAV (N\u2009=\u200962) and TAV (N\u2009=\u200954) patients.

Our results collectively showed the molecular signature of an endothelial/epithelial-mesenchymal (EndMT/EMT) transition-like process, associated with instability of intimal cell junctions and activation of RHOA pathway in the intima and media layers of ascending aorta in BAV patients. We propose that an improper regulation of EndMT/EMT during the spatiotemporally related embryogenesis of semilunar valves and ascending aorta in BAV individuals may result in aortic immaturity and instability prior to dilation. Exasperation of EndMT/EMT state in post embryonic life and/or exposure to non-physiological hemodynamic could lead to the aneurysm of ascending aorta in BAV individuals.", "doi": "10.1038/srep35712", "pmid": "27779199", "labels": {"Clinical Proteomics Mass spectrometry": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "srep35712"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5078843"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4f90bb3bf07a4fe28c6fd66458e7aa15.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4f90bb3bf07a4fe28c6fd66458e7aa15"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "58b908552486434789e2c732abbbaeea", "title": "Auxotrophy-based High Throughput Screening assay for the identification of Bacillus subtilis stringent response inhibitors.", "authors": [{"family": "Andresen", "given": "Liis", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Varik", "given": "Vallo", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Tozawa", "given": "Yuzuru", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Jimmy", "given": "Steffi", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Stina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Tenson", "given": "Tanel", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hauryliuk", "given": "Vasili", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-10-24", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "35824", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "The stringent response is a central adaptation mechanism that allows bacteria to adjust their growth and metabolism according to environmental conditions.

Responses in 3 different treatments amended with thiosulfate, ammonium or organic matter (i.e., pyruvate plus acetate) were compared to unamended controls. The strongest stimulation was found in the organic matter enrichments, where all measured rates increased >10-fold. Strikingly, in the organic matter treatment, the dark DIC fixation rates-assumed to be related to autotrophic metabolisms-were equally stimulated as all the other heterotrophic-related parameters. This increase in DIC fixation rates was paralleled by an up-regulation of genes involved in DIC assimilation via anaplerotic pathways. Alkaline phosphatase was the metabolic rate most strongly stimulated and its activity seemed to be related to cross-activation by nonpartner histidine kinases, and/or the activation of genes involved in the regulation of elemental balance during catabolic processes. These findings suggest that episodic events such as strong sedimentation of organic matter into the mesopelagic might trigger rapid increases of originally rare members of the prokaryotic community, enhancing heterotrophic and autotrophic carbon uptake rates, ultimately affecting carbon cycling.

We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science.

Unexpectedly, while the latter strategy detected the synthetic loxP region and correctly genotyped KO1st chimeric mice, the same individuals were genotyped as wild-type when using the primers that flanked the synthetic loxP region.

This hexapeptide is thought to facilitate learning and memory by binding to the catalytic site of IRAP to inhibit its enzymatic activity. In support of this hypothesis, low molecular weight, nonpeptide specific inhibitors of IRAP have been shown to enhance memory in rodent models. Recently, it was demonstrated that linear and macrocyclic Ang IV-derived peptides can alter the shape and increase the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal cultures, properties associated with enhanced cognitive performance. After screening a library of 10\u202f500 drug-like substances for their ability to inhibit IRAP, we identified a series of low molecular weight aryl sulfonamides, which exhibit no structural similarity to Ang IV, as moderately potent IRAP inhibitors. A structural and biological characterization of three of these aryl sulfonamides was performed.

Here, we investigated selection on pollen and pistil traits when pollen arrives sequentially to partially receptive pistils in relation to pollen competition and a sexual conflict over timing of stigma receptivity in the mixed-mating annual Collinsia heterophylla (Plantaginaceae). In this species the conflict is generated by early fertilizing pollen that reduces seed production, which is counteracted by delaying receptivity in the recipient. We performed sequential two-donor pollinations at early floral developmental stages involving two pollen deposition schedules (with or without a time lag of 1\u2009day), using only outcross or self and outcross pollen. We investigated pollen and pistil traits in relation to siring success (male fitness) and seed production (female fitness). In contrast to previous findings in receptive pistils in C. heterophylla and in other species, last arriving pollen donors showed highest siring success in partially receptive pistils. The last male advantage was weaker when self pollen was the first arriving donor. Two measures of germination rate (early and late) and pollen tube growth rate of first arriving donors were important for siring success in crosses with a time lag, while only late germination rate had an effect in contemporary crosses. Curiously, late stigma receptivity was negatively related to seed production in our contemporary crosses, which was opposite to expectation. Our results in combination with previous studies suggest that pollen and pistil traits in C. heterophylla are differentially advantageous depending on stage of floral development and varying pollen deposition schedules.

Also, one of the female X chromosomes may be inactivated. Therefore, special test statistics and quality control procedures are required. Thus, little is known about the role of X-chromosomal variants in CAD. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive X-chromosome-wide meta-analysis including more than 43,000 CAD cases and 58,000 controls from 35 international study cohorts. For quality control, sex-specific filters were used to adequately take the special structure of X-chromosomal data into account. For single study analyses, several logistic regression models were calculated allowing for inactivation of one female X-chromosome, adjusting for sex and investigating interactions between sex and genetic variants. Then, meta-analyses including all 35 studies were conducted using random effects models. None of the investigated models revealed genome-wide significant associations for any variant.

Farming spread into west\u00a0Anatolia by the early seventh millennium cal BC and quasi-synchronously into Europe, although the timing and process of this movement remain unclear. Using genome sequence data that we generated from nine central Anatolian Neolithic individuals, we studied the transition period from early Aceramic (Pre-Pottery) to the later Pottery Neolithic, when farming expanded west of the Fertile Crescent. We find that genetic diversity in the earliest farmers was conspicuously low, on a par with European foraging groups. With the advent of the Pottery Neolithic, genetic variation within societies reached levels later found in early European farmers. Our results confirm that the earliest Neolithic central Anatolians belonged to the same gene pool as the first Neolithic migrants spreading into Europe. Further, genetic affinities between later Anatolian farmers and fourth to third millennium BC Chalcolithic south Europeans suggest an additional wave of Anatolian migrants, after the initial Neolithic spread but before the Yamnaya-related migrations.

Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial antibiotic pollution and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event.\n\nOur study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance.

Here we propose two normalization approaches utilizing MA coordinates. The multidimensional MA (multi-MA) and MA-loess both consider all samples of a microtiter plate per suspension bead array assay and thus do not require any external reference samples. We demonstrate the performance of the two MA normalization methods with data obtained from the analysis of 384 samples including both serum and plasma. Samples were randomized across 96-well sample plates, processed, and analyzed in assay plates, respectively. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we could show that plate-wise clusters found in the first two components were eliminated by multi-MA normalization as compared with other normalization methods. Furthermore, we studied the correlation profiles between random pairs of antibodies and found that both MA normalization methods substantially reduced the inflated correlation introduced by plate effects. Normalization approaches using multi-MA and MA-loess minimized batch effects arising from the analysis of several assay plates with antibody suspension bead arrays.

We show that the performance of these predictors is on par with ProQ2 and significantly better than all other model quality assessment programs. Furthermore, we show that combining the input features from all three predictors, the resulting predictor ProQ3 performs better than any of the individual methods.

On the other hand, proteomics can quantitatively measure the abundances of thousands of proteins in a single experiment. Thus proteomics could develop a modern alternative to both semiquantitative morphology assessment as well as single-molecule biochemical assays. Here we tested this hypothesis by analyzing the proteomes of cells dying after been treated with various chemical agents. The most striking finding is that, for a multivariate model based on the proteome changes in three cells lines, the regulation patterns of the 200-500 most abundant proteins typically attributed to household type more accurately reflect that of the proteins directly interacting with the drug than any other protein subset grouped by common function or biological process, including cell death. This is in broad agreement with the 'rigid cell death mechanics' model where drug action mechanism and morphological changes caused by it are bijectively linked. This finding, if confirmed, will open way for a broad use of proteomics in death modality assessment.", "doi": "10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.68", "pmid": "27752363", "labels": {"Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5045961"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d9df95117cca4865844a68d46d0f9020.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d9df95117cca4865844a68d46d0f9020"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4dcd29c23e274c7ebf5984277dc1182f", "title": "Scaffolding protein IQGAP1: an insulin-dependent link between caveolae and the cytoskeleton in primary human adipocytes?", "authors": [{"family": "Jufvas", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rajan", "given": "M R", "initials": "MR"}, {"family": "Jo\u00a0nsson", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Stralfors", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Turkina", "given": "M V", "initials": "MV"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "473", "issn": "0264-6021", "issue": "19", "pages": "3177-3188", "title": "Biochemical Journal"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1042/bcj20160581", "pmid": null, "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4dcd29c23e274c7ebf5984277dc1182f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4dcd29c23e274c7ebf5984277dc1182f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6ffde39b841646ddabda81c99083c219", "title": "Estrogen Receptor \u03b1 Promotes Breast Cancer by Reprogramming Choline Metabolism.", "authors": [{"family": "Jia", "given": "Min", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andreassen", "given": "Trygve", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Jensen", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bathen", "given": "Tone Frost", "initials": "TF"}, {"family": "Sinha", "given": "Indranil", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Gao", "given": "Hui", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Chunyan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Haldosen", "given": "Lars-Arne", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Cao", "given": "Yihai", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Girnita", "given": "Leonard", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Moestue", "given": "Siver Andreas", "initials": "SA"}, {"family": "Dahlman-Wright", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "76", "issn": "1538-7445", "issue": "19", "pages": "5634-5646", "title": "Cancer Res."}, "abstract": "Estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) is a key regulator of breast growth and breast cancer development. Here, we report how ER\u03b1 impacts these processes by reprogramming metabolism in malignant breast cells. We employed an integrated approach, combining genome-wide mapping of chromatin-bound ER\u03b1 with estrogen-induced transcript and metabolic profiling, to demonstrate that ER\u03b1 reprograms metabolism upon estrogen stimulation, including changes in aerobic glycolysis, nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, and choline (Cho) metabolism. Cho phosphotransferase CHPT1, identified as a direct ER\u03b1-regulated gene, was required for estrogen-induced effects on Cho metabolism, including increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis. CHPT1 silencing inhibited anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation, also suppressing early-stage metastasis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. Our results showed that ER\u03b1 promotes metabolic alterations in breast cancer cells mediated by its target CHPT1, which this study implicates as a candidate therapeutic target.

We exome-sequenced 200 morbidly obese subjects and 100 control subjects with pooled DNA samples. After several filtering steps, we retained 439 obesity-enriched low-frequency coding variants. Associations between genetic variants and obesity were validated sequentially in two case-control cohorts. In the final analysis of 1,911 morbidly obese and 1,274 control subjects, rs2076349 showed strong association with obesity (P = 9.67 \u00d7 10(-5); odds ratio 1.84). This variant was also associated with BMI and fasting serum leptin. Moreover, LAMB3 expression in adipose tissue was positively correlated with BMI and adipose morphology (few but large fat cells). LAMB3 knockdown by small interfering RNA in human adipocytes cultured in vitro inhibited adipogenesis.

We also found that enzymatic TrxR activity in serum is counteracted by a yet unidentified oxidase activity in serum. In the present study we found that mice carrying H22 hepatocellular carcinoma tumors present highly increased levels of TrxR in serum, similarly to that reported in human patients. In this case ALT levels did not parallel those of TrxR. We also discovered here that the TrxR-antagonistic oxidase activity in serum is due to the presence of quiescin Q6 sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1). We furthermore found that the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin or auranofin, when given systemically to H22 tumor bearing mice, can further inhibit TrxR activities in serum. The TrxR serum activity was also inhibited by endogenous electrophilic inhibitors, found to increase in tumor-bearing mice and to include protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Thus, hepatocellular carcinoma triggers high levels of serum TrxR that are not paralleled by ALT, and TrxR enzyme activity in serum is counteracted by several different mechanisms.

The microbial community at the shallow site was the most dynamic and was dominated by the sulfur-oxidizing genera Sulfurovum or Sulfurimonas at all-time points. The microbial community in the meteoric water filled intermediate aquifer (water turnover approximately every 5 years) was less variable and was dominated by candidate phylum OD1. Metagenomic analysis of this water demonstrated the occurrence of key genes for nitrogen and carbon fixation, sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation and fermentation. The deepest water mass (5000 year old waters) had the lowest taxon richness and surprisingly contained Cyanobacteria. The high relative abundance of phylogenetic groups associated with nitrogen and sulfur cycling, as well as fermentation implied that these processes were important in these systems.

By using laser capture microdissection and a quantitative PCR array, 23 of 84 examined ISGs were found to be overexpressed by at least fivefold in insulitic islets from living patients with recent-onset T1D, participating in the Diabetes Virus Detection (DiViD) study, compared with islets from organ donors without diabetes. Most of the overexpressed ISGs, including GBP1, TLR3, OAS1, EIF2AK2, HLA-E, IFI6, and STAT1, showed higher expression in the islet core compared with the peri-islet area containing the surrounding immune cells. In contrast, the T-cell attractant chemokine CXCL10 showed an almost 10-fold higher expression in the peri-islet area than in the islet, possibly partly explaining the localization of T cells mainly to this region. In conclusion, insulitic islets from recent-onset T1D subjects show overexpression of ISGs, with an expression pattern similar to that seen in islets infected with virus or exposed to IFN-\u03b3/interleukin-1\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1.", "doi": "10.2337/db16-0616", "pmid": "27422384", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "db16-0616"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2bda6924787f4ca782fd837c05e0deba.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2bda6924787f4ca782fd837c05e0deba"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2d02c07f54bc450c9b3c7d235a196db7", "title": "Gene\u2010specific correlation of RNA and protein levels in human cells and tissues", "authors": [{"family": "Edfors", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Danielsson", "given": "Frida", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hallstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "K\u00e4ll", "given": "Lukas", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Forsstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1744-4292", "issue": "10", "pages": "883", "title": "Mol.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on SB may help to understand this risk, but have been hampered by low power due to limited sample sizes, weakly ascertained SB or a reliance on single-nucleotide protein (SNP)-by-SNP analyses. Here, we tried to mitigate such issues with polygenic risk score (PRS) association tests combined with hypothesis-driven strategies using a family-based sample of 660 trios with a well-ascertained suicide attempt (SA) outcome in the offspring (Genetic Investigation of Suicide and SA, GISS). Two complementary sources of PRS information were used. First, a PRS that was discovered and validated in the GISS SA revealed the polygenic association of SNPs in 750 neurodevelopmental genes, which was driven by the SA phenotype, rather than the major psychiatric diagnoses. Second, a PRS based on three different genome-wide association studies (on SCZ, BPD or MDD) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) showed an association of the PGC-SCZ PRS in the SA subjects with and without major psychiatric diagnoses. We characterized the PGC-SCZ overlap in the SA subjects without diagnoses. The extended major histocompatibility complex region did not contribute to the overlap, but we delineated the genic overlap to neurodevelopmental genes that partially overlapped with those identified by the GISS PRS. Among the 590 SA polygenes implicated here, there were several developmentally important functions (cell adhesion/migration, small GTPase and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling), and 16 of the SA polygenes have previously been studied in SB (BDNF, CDH10, CDH12, CDH13, CDH9, CREB1, DLK1, DLK2, EFEMP1, FOXN3, IL2, LSAMP, NCAM1, nerve growth factor (NGF), NTRK2 and TBC1D1). These novel genome-wide insights, supported by two lines of evidence, suggested the importance of a polygenic neurodevelopmental etiology in SB, even in the absence of major psychiatric diagnoses.", "doi": "10.1038/mp.2015.187", "pmid": "26666204", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mp2015187"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3ad3dd86ecb94b56aca3c7a1273f8193.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3ad3dd86ecb94b56aca3c7a1273f8193"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "489f13ae6632480998792a7befd4e27b", "title": "A proposal for validation of antibodies.", "authors": [{"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bandrowski", "given": "Anita", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Carr", "given": "Steven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Edwards", "given": "Aled", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ellenberg", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rimm", "given": "David L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Rodriguez", "given": "Henry", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Hiltke", "given": "Tara", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Snyder", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Yamamoto", "given": "Tadashi", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "13", "issn": "1548-7105", "issue": "10", "pages": "823-827", "title": "Nat.

However, its large-scale implementation requires tools and technologies that allow development of suitable antibody or antibody fragments in a high-throughput manner. To address this we designed and constructed two human synthetic antibody fragment (scFv) libraries denoted HelL-11 and HelL-13. By the use of phage display technology, in total 466 unique scFv antibodies specific for 114 different antigens were generated. The specificities of these antibodies were analyzed in a variety of immunochemical assays and a subset was further evaluated for functionality in protein microarray applications. This high-throughput approach demonstrates the ability to rapidly generate a wealth of reagents not only for proteome research, but potentially also for diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition, this work provides a great example on how a synthetic approach can be used to optimize library designs. By having precise control of the diversity introduced into the antigen-binding sites, synthetic libraries offer increased understanding of how different diversity contributes to antibody binding reactivity and stability, thereby providing the key to future library optimization.", "doi": "10.1093/protein/gzw042", "pmid": "27590051", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": "Collaborative", "Drug Discovery and Development (DDD)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "gzw042"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5fb26da1ec574acf99e51cdca6e833d5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5fb26da1ec574acf99e51cdca6e833d5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7362e0a1c4f5433180f790928a646f82", "title": "Urea-Dependent Adenylate Kinase Activation following Redistribution of Structural States", "authors": [{"family": "Rogne", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Wolf-Watz", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "111", "issn": "0006-3495", "issue": "7", "pages": "1385-1395", "title": "Biophysical Journal"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2016.08.028", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7362e0a1c4f5433180f790928a646f82.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7362e0a1c4f5433180f790928a646f82"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "79da525d578e49858d9311a9c79edce3", "title": "Factors regulating capillary remodeling in a reversible model of inflammatory corneal angiogenesis", "authors": [{"family": "Mukwaya", "given": "Anthony", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Peebo", "given": "Beatrice", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Xeroudaki", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ali", "given": "Zaheer", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Lennikov", "given": "Anton", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Jensen", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Lagali", "given": "Neil", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": "1", "pages": null, "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/srep32137", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/79da525d578e49858d9311a9c79edce3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/79da525d578e49858d9311a9c79edce3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "835b4387dc4346fa98011ea1eab1dd41", "title": "Various Antibody Clones of Napsin A, Thyroid Transcription Factor 1, and p40 and Comparisons With Cytokeratin 5 and p63 in Histopathologic Diagnostics of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Tran", "given": "Lena", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Johanna S M", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Nodin", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "J\u00f6nsson", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Planck", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jirstr\u00f6m", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Botling", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Micke", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Brunnstr\u00f6m", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "1533-4058", "issue": "9", "pages": "648-659", "title": "Appl.

Cytokeratin 5 (CK5), p63, and p40 are commonly used immunohistochemical markers for squamous cell carcinoma, and napsin A (NAPA) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) are markers for adenocarcinoma of the lung. The aim of the present study was to evaluate these 5 markers and to compare different commercially available antibody clones in lung cancer. Tissue microarrays including 557 cases of surgically treated primary tumors and 73 matched metastases of non-small cell lung carcinoma were stained with CK5, p63, p40 (monoclonal and polyclonal), NAPA (5 different clones/protocols), and TTF-1 (2 different clones). The sensitivity and specificity to separate squamous cell carcinomas from non-small cell carcinomas of nonsquamous type were 95% and 97%, respectively, for CK5, 95% and 87% for p63, 94% and 96% for p40, 75% to 79% and 96% to 98% for the NAPA clones/protocols and 80% to 85% and 95% to 97% for the TTF-1 clones. A combination of NAPA and TTF-1 resulted in a higher sensitivity (85% to 88%), whereas combining CK5 and p40 did not increase the diagnostic performance. The sensitivity was generally lower in evaluation of lung cancer metastases. The \u03ba-values for comparison of staining results between monoclonal and polyclonal p40 and between the 5 NAPA clones/protocols were 0.97 to 1.0, whereas the corresponding figure for the 2 TTF-1 clones was 0.91 to 0.93. Conclusively, CK5 and p40 are good diagnostic markers for squamous cell carcinoma and superior to p63. In addition, it may be useful to combine NAPA and TTF-1 for increased sensitivity in lung cancer diagnostics. There is no substantial difference between monoclonal and polyclonal p40 and between different NAPA clones, whereas there is a difference between the TTF-1 clones 8G7G3/1 and SPT24.", "doi": "10.1097/PAI.0000000000000235", "pmid": "26447895", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/835b4387dc4346fa98011ea1eab1dd41.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/835b4387dc4346fa98011ea1eab1dd41"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "84d7df2e060747a38f307e22e4e11d64", "title": "Autoantibodies Targeting a Collecting Duct-Specific Water Channel in Tubulointerstitial Nephritis.", "authors": [{"family": "Landegren", "given": "Nils", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Pourmousa Lindberg", "given": "Mina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Skov", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hallgren", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lisberg Toft-Bertelsen", "given": "Trine", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "MacAulay", "given": "Nanna", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hagforsen", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "R\u00e4is\u00e4nen-Sokolowski", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Saha", "given": "Heikki", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Nordmark", "given": "Gunnel", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ohlsson", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gustafsson", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Husebye", "given": "Eystein S", "initials": "ES"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Anderson", "given": "Mark S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Perheentupa", "given": "Jaakko", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rorsman", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Fenton", "given": "Robert A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "K\u00e4mpe", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "27", "issn": "1533-3450", "issue": "10", "pages": "3220-3228", "title": "J.

We identified 66 blood pressure-associated loci, of which 17 were new; 15 harbored multiple distinct association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood pressure risk score was significantly associated with target organ damage in multiple tissues but with minor effects in the kidney.

Consistent with this, a cd93-deficient mouse model (in addition to apoe deficiency) demonstrated no difference in atherosclerotic lesion development compared with apoe(-/-) cd93-sufficient littermates. However, cd93-deficient mice showed impaired glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity (compared with littermate controls) after eating a high-fat diet. The expression of cd93 was observed in pancreatic islets, and leaky vessels were apparent in cd93-deficient pancreases.

Studies of non-human primate pedigrees and human twins suggest that this is due to common genetic influences. We tested whether personality polygenic scores for the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) domains and for item response theory (IRT) derived extraversion and neuroticism scores predict variance in wellbeing measures. Polygenic scores were based on published genome-wide association (GWA) results in over 17,000 individuals for the NEO-FFI and in over 63,000 for the IRT extraversion and neuroticism traits. The NEO-FFI polygenic scores were used to predict life satisfaction in 7 cohorts, positive affect in 12 cohorts, and general wellbeing in 1 cohort (maximal N = 46,508). Meta-analysis of these results showed no significant association between NEO-FFI personality polygenic scores and the wellbeing measures. IRT extraversion and neuroticism polygenic scores were used to predict life satisfaction and positive affect in almost 37,000 individuals from UK Biobank. Significant positive associations (effect sizes <0.05%) were observed between the extraversion polygenic score and wellbeing measures, and a negative association was observed between the polygenic neuroticism score and life satisfaction. Furthermore, using GWA data, genetic correlations of -0.49 and -0.55 were estimated between neuroticism with life satisfaction and positive affect, respectively.

These technologies have enabled previously unimaginable studies, including draft assemblies of the massive genomes of coniferous species and population-scale resequencing. Transcriptomics studies have likewise been transformed, with RNA-sequencing enabling studies in nonmodel organisms, the discovery of previously unannotated genes (novel transcripts), entirely new classes of RNAs and previously unknown regulatory mechanisms.

Following an episode of natural immigration to the isolated, severely inbred Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population, we demonstrate significantly higher pairing and breeding success for offspring to immigrants compared to offspring from native, inbred pairs. We argue that inbreeding depression is the underlying mechanism for the profound difference in breeding success. Highly inbred wolves may have lower survival during natal dispersal as well as competitive disadvantage to find a partner. Our study is one of the first to quantify and compare the reproductive success of first-generation offspring from migrants vs. native, inbred individuals in a natural population.

Discovery for genetic association was performed in 16,753 individuals, and replication was attempted for the 23 most significant novel loci in 13,354 independent individuals. Association with ISI was tested in models adjusted for age, sex, and BMI and in a model analyzing the combined influence of the genotype effect adjusted for BMI and the interaction effect between the genotype and BMI on ISI (model 3). In model 3, three variants reached genome-wide significance: rs13422522 (NYAP2; P = 8.87 \u00d7 10(-11)), rs12454712 (BCL2; P = 2.7 \u00d7 10(-8)), and rs10506418 (FAM19A2; P = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-8)). The association at NYAP2 was eliminated by conditioning on the known IRS1 insulin sensitivity locus; the BCL2 and FAM19A2 associations were independent of known cardiometabolic loci.

To address the mechanism of FLT3 inhibitor resistance, we generated two resistant AML cell lines by sustained treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. Parental cell lines carry the FLT3-ITD (tandem duplication) mutation and are highly responsive to FLT3 inhibitors, whereas resistant cell lines display resistance to multiple FLT3 inhibitors. Sanger sequencing and protein mass-spectrometry did not identify any acquired mutations in FLT3 in the resistant cells. Moreover, sorafenib treatment effectively blocked FLT3 activation in resistant cells, whereas it was unable to block colony formation or cell survival, suggesting that the resistant cells are no longer FLT3 dependent. Gene expression analysis of sensitive and resistant cell lines, as well as of blasts from patients with sorafenib-resistant AML, suggested an enrichment of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in the resistant phenotype, which was further supported by next-generation sequencing and phospho-specific-antibody array analysis. Furthermore, a selective PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, gedatolisib, efficiently blocked proliferation, colony and tumor formation, and induced apoptosis in resistant cell lines. Gedatolisib significantly extended survival of mice in a sorafenib-resistant AML patient-derived xenograft model.

Although Mozambique can be considered a hot spot for emerging infectious diseases due to factors such as a rich vector population and a close vector/human/wildlife interface, the viral flora in mosquitoes have not previously been investigated. In this study, viral metagenomics was employed to analyze the viral communities in Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes in the Zambezia province of Mozambique. Among the 1.7 and 2.6 million sequences produced from the Culex and Mansonia samples, respectively, 3269 and 983 reads were classified as viral sequences. Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Iflaviridae families were detected, and different unclassified single- and double-stranded RNA viruses were also identified. A near complete genome of a flavivirus, tentatively named Cuacua virus, was obtained from the Mansonia mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of this flavivirus, using the NS5 amino acid sequence, showed that it grouped with 'insect-specific' viruses and was most closely related to Nakiwogo virus previously identified in Uganda. Both mosquito genera had viral sequences related to Rhabdoviruses, and these were most closely related to Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus (CTRV).

Major breakthroughs have been made dissecting the molecular basis of auxin transport, perception, and response. In contrast, how plants control the metabolism and homeostasis of the major form of auxin in plants, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), remains unclear. In this paper, we initially describe the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene DIOXYGENASE FOR AUXIN OXIDATION 1 (AtDAO1). Transcriptional and translational reporter lines revealed that AtDAO1 encodes a highly root-expressed, cytoplasmically localized IAA oxidase. Stable isotope-labeled IAA feeding studies of loss and gain of function AtDAO1 lines showed that this oxidase represents the major regulator of auxin degradation to 2-oxoindole-3-acetic acid (oxIAA) in Arabidopsis Surprisingly, AtDAO1 loss and gain of function lines exhibited relatively subtle auxin-related phenotypes, such as altered root hair length. Metabolite profiling of mutant lines revealed that disrupting AtDAO1 regulation resulted in major changes in steady-state levels of oxIAA and IAA conjugates but not IAA. Hence, IAA conjugation and catabolism seem to regulate auxin levels in Arabidopsis in a highly redundant manner. We observed that transcripts of AtDOA1 IAA oxidase and GH3 IAA-conjugating enzymes are auxin-inducible, providing a molecular basis for their observed functional redundancy.

There was a strong positive correlation between diversity and chromosome size, probably driven by a higher density of targets for selection on smaller chromosomes increasing the diversity-reducing effect of linked selection.

To date, the interactions of these domains with unfolded proteins have remained rather obscure, with structural information on binding to the FKBP domain being limited to complexes involving various inhibitor compounds or a chemically modified tetrapeptide.\n\nWe have characterized the binding of 15-residue-long unmodified peptides to SlyD from Thermus thermophilus (TtSlyD) in terms of binding thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and site-directed mutagenesis. We show that the affinities and enzymatic activity of TtSlyD towards these peptides are much higher than for the chemically modified tetrapeptides that are typically used for activity measurements on FKBPs. In addition, we present a series of crystal structures of TtSlyD with the inhibitor FK506 bound to the FKBP domain, and with 15-residue-long peptides bound to either one or both domains, which reveals that substrates bind in a highly adaptable fashion to the IF domain through \u03b2-strand augmentation, and can bind to the FKBP domain as both types VIa1 and VIb-like cis-proline \u03b2-turns. Our results furthermore provide important clues to the catalytic mechanism and support the notion of inter-domain cross talk.\n\nWe found that 15-residue-long unmodified peptides can serve as better substrate mimics for the IF and FKBP domains than chemically modified tetrapeptides. We furthermore show how such peptides are recognized by each of these domains in TtSlyD, and propose a novel general model for the catalytic mechanism of FKBPs that involves C-terminal rotation around the peptidyl-prolyl bond mediated by stabilization of the twisted transition state in the hydrophobic binding site.", "doi": "10.1186/s12915-016-0300-3", "pmid": "27664121", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12915-016-0300-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5034536"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bb87bcdea2804a1c8ebda5e64351759c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bb87bcdea2804a1c8ebda5e64351759c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6b0a0e0207ca4d228b680e286f591f57", "title": "The Oncolytic Efficacy and in Vivo Pharmacokinetics of [2-(4-Chlorophenyl)quinolin-4-yl](piperidine-2-yl)methanol (Vacquinol-1) Are Governed by Distinct Stereochemical Features.", "authors": [{"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lars G J", "initials": "LG"}, {"family": "Harmel", "given": "Robert K", "initials": "RK"}, {"family": "Granath", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ringom", "given": "Rune", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gravenfors", "given": "Ylva", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "F\u00e4rneg\u00e5rdh", "given": "Katarina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Per H", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Wennman", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lundin", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Roddis", "given": "Ylva", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Kitambi", "given": "Satish S", "initials": "SS"}, {"family": "Bernlind", "given": "Alexandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lehmann", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ernfors", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-09-22", "journal": {"volume": "59", "issn": "1520-4804", "issue": "18", "pages": "8577-8592", "title": "J.

In this study, we evaluated MAF estimates using three variant detection tools with two sets of pooled whole exome sequencing (WES) and one set of pooled whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Both GATK and Freebayes displayed high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy when detecting rare or low-frequency variants. For the WGS study, 56% of the low-frequency variants in Illumina array have identical MAFs and 26% have one allele difference between sequencing and individual genotyping data. The MAF estimates from WGS correlated well (r\u2009=\u20090.94) with those from Illumina arrays. The MAFs from the pooled WES data also showed high concordance (r\u2009=\u20090.88) with those from the individual genotyping data.

Recently, the nucleoside diphosphate hydrolase NUDT15 has received attention on the basis of its ability to hydrolyze the thiopurine effector metabolites 6-thio-deoxyGTP (6-thio-dGTP) and 6-thio-GTP, thereby limiting the efficacy of thiopurines. In particular, increasing evidence suggests an association between the NUDT15 missense variant, R139C, and thiopurine sensitivity. In this study, we elucidated the role of NUDT15 and NUDT15 R139C in thiopurine metabolism. In vitro and cellular results argued that 6-thio-dGTP and 6-thio-GTP are favored substrates for NUDT15, a finding supported by a crystallographic determination of NUDT15 in complex with 6-thio-GMP. We found that NUDT15 R139C mutation did not affect enzymatic activity but instead negatively influenced protein stability, likely due to a loss of supportive intramolecular bonds that caused rapid proteasomal degradation in cells. Mechanistic investigations in cells indicated that NUDT15 ablation potentiated induction of the DNA damage checkpoint and cancer cell death by 6-thioguanine. Taken together, our results defined how NUDT15 limits thiopurine efficacy and how genetic ablation via the R139C missense mutation confers sensitivity to thiopurine treatment in patients.

The icosahedral capsid contains 120-subunits and resembles another closely related arthropod-borne totivirus-like virus, the infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) from shrimps. Both viruses have an elevated plateau around their icosahedral 5-fold axes, surrounded by a deep canyon. Sequence and structural analysis suggests that this plateau region is mainly composed of the extended C-terminal region of the capsid proteins. In contrast to IMNV, the infectious form of OmRV lacks extensive fibre complexes at its 5-fold axes as directly confirmed by a contrast-enhancement technique, using Zernike phase-contrast cryo-EM. Instead, these fibre complexes are replaced by a short \"plug\" structure at the five-fold axes of OmRV.

In contrast to widespread assessments of statistically significant associations between DNA polymorphisms and quantitative traits, we developed a computational tool to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms by which genetic markers drive variation in RNA-processing, cataloguing and classifying alleles that change the affinity of core RNA elements to their recognizing factors. The in silico models we employ further suggest RNA editing can moonlight as a splicing-modulator, albeit less frequently than genomic sequence diversity.

Crystal structure analyses revealed the formation of BR187-385 homo-dimers via an intermolecular \u03b2-sheet, resulting in a positively charged concave surface, shaped to accommodate the acidic helical DNA structure. Furthermore, small angle X-ray scattering and circular dichroism studies indicate that the aggregate-enhancing N-terminal region of BR120-166 adopts an extended, non-globular structure.

In animals, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is used to induce inflammation and behaviors analogous to some of the symptoms in these disorders. Recent data indicate that the kynurenine pathway contributes to LPS-induced aberrant behaviors. However, data are inconclusive regarding optimal LPS dose and treatment strategy. Here, we therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of single versus repeated administration of LPS on the kynurenine pathway. Adult C57BL6 mice were given 0.83\u00a0mg/kg LPS as a single or a repeated injection (LPS\u00a0+\u00a0LPS) and sacrificed after 24, 48, 72, or 120\u00a0h. Mice receiving LPS\u00a0+\u00a0LPS had significantly elevated brain kynurenine levels at 24 and 48\u00a0h, and elevated serum kynurenine at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h. Brain kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid were significantly increased at 24 and 48\u00a0h in mice receiving LPS\u00a0+\u00a0LPS, whereas serum kynurenic acid levels were significantly decreased at 24\u00a0h. The increase of brain kynurenic acid by LPS\u00a0+\u00a0LPS was likely unrelated to the higher total dose as a separate group of mice receiving 1.66\u00a0mg/kg LPS as single injection 24\u00a0h prior to sacrifice did not show increased brain kynurenic acid.

These antigens are presented to T cells in the form of peptides bound to HLA molecules on antigen presenting cells, e.g. dendritic cells, macrophages or B cells. The identification of HLA-DR-bound peptides presents a valuable tool to investigate the human immunopeptidome. The lung is likely a key player in the activation of potentially auto-aggressive T cells prior to entering target tissues and inducing autoimmune disease. This makes the lung of exceptional interest and presents an ideal paradigm to study the human immunopeptidome and to identify antigenic peptides.Our previous investigation of HLA-DR peptide presentation in the lung required high numbers of cells (800 \u00d7 10(6) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells). Because BAL from healthy nonsmokers typically contains 10-15 \u00d7 10(6) cells, there is a need for a highly sensitive approach to study immunopeptides in the lungs of individual patients and controls.In this work, we analyzed the HLA-DR immunopeptidome in the lung by an optimized methodology to identify HLA-DR-bound peptides from low cell numbers. We used an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immortalized B cell line and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells obtained from patients with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory T cell driven disease mainly occurring in the lung. Specifically, membrane complexes were isolated prior to immunoprecipitation, eluted peptides were identified by nanoLC-MS/MS and processed using the in-house developed ClusterMHCII software. With the optimized procedure we were able to identify peptides from 10 \u00d7 10(6) cells, which on average correspond to 10.9 peptides/million cells in EBV-B cells and 9.4 peptides/million cells in BAL cells. This work presents an optimized approach designed to identify HLA-DR-bound peptides from low numbers of cells, enabling the investigation of the BAL immunopeptidome from individual patients and healthy controls in order to identify disease-associated peptides.", "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M116.060764", "pmid": "27452731", "labels": {"Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M116.060764"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5013314"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/01e09e067bd1413d85933b0a9e75ede8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/01e09e067bd1413d85933b0a9e75ede8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "02d76cd334a44d96af295cc57d1d359a", "title": "Protein profiles of CCL5, HPGDS, and NPSR1 in plasma reveal association with childhood asthma.", "authors": [{"family": "Hamsten", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "H\u00e4ggmark", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Grundstr\u00f6m", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mikus", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lindskog", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Konradsen", "given": "J R", "initials": "JR"}, {"family": "Eklund", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pershagen", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Wickman", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Grunewald", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mel\u00e9n", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hedlin", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "van Hage", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-09-00", "journal": {"volume": "71", "issn": "1398-9995", "issue": "9", "pages": "1357-1361", "title": "Allergy"}, "abstract": "Asthma is a common chronic childhood disease with many different phenotypes that need to be identified.

However, on extremely rare occasions when damages to DNA or replication errors are not repaired, germline mutations can be transmitted to the next generation. Because of the rarity of these events, studying the rate at which new mutations arise across organisms has been a great challenge, especially in multicellular nonmodel organisms with large genomes. We sequenced the genomes of 11 birds from a three-generation pedigree of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) and used highly stringent bioinformatic criteria for mutation detection and used several procedures to validate mutations, including following the stable inheritance of new mutations to subsequent generations. We identified 55 de novo mutations with a 10-fold enrichment of mutations at CpG sites and with only a modest male mutation bias. The estimated rate of mutation per site per generation was 4.6 \u00d7 10(-9), which corresponds to 2.3 \u00d7 10(-9) mutations per site per year. Compared to mammals, this is similar to mouse but about half of that reported for humans, which may be due to the higher frequency of male mutations in humans. We confirm that mutation rate scales positively with genome size and that there is a strong negative relationship between mutation rate and effective population size, in line with the drift-barrier hypothesis.

In the present study, we present data from the preceding rat toxicity study, demonstrating that AZD4619 had no effect on rat serum ALT activity levels, and further experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this species-related difference. Our results revealed that AZD4619 increased ALT1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in human, but not in rat primary hepatocytes.

In selected entities, a predominantly mutated gene is identified in almost all cases (e.g. Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and hairy-cell leukemia), while for the vast majority of lymphomas a quite diverse mutation pattern is observed, with a limited number of frequently mutated genes followed by a seemingly endless tail of genes with mutations at a low frequency.

In the coming years, coordinated efforts aiming to apply targeted next-generation sequencing in large patient series will be needed in order to elucidate if a particular gene mutation will have an immediate impact on the lymphoma classification, and ultimately aid clinical decision making.", "doi": "10.3324/haematol.2015.134510", "pmid": "27582569", "labels": {"Clinical Genomics Uppsala": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "haematol.2015.134510"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5060016"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2f904bcb58394960be1f25f57256b133.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2f904bcb58394960be1f25f57256b133"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4459a54010c74509b02e375cad6671b5", "title": "Epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation reveals a rectal cancer-specific epigenomic signature.", "authors": [{"family": "Vymetalkova", "given": "Veronika", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Vodicka", "given": "Pavel", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Pardini", "given": "Barbara", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Rosa", "given": "Fabio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Levy", "given": "Miroslav", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schneiderova", "given": "Michaela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Liska", "given": "Vaclav", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Vodickova", "given": "Ludmila", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Torbj\u00f6rn K", "initials": "TK"}, {"family": "Farkas", "given": "Sanja A", "initials": "SA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-09-00", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1750-192X", "issue": "9", "pages": "1193-1207", "title": "Epigenomics"}, "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to address a genome-wide search for novel methylation biomarkers in the rectal cancer (RC), as only scarce information on methylation profile is available.\n\nWe analyzed methylation status in 25 pairs of RC and adjacent healthy mucosa using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip.\n\nWe found significantly aberrant methylation in 33 genes.

Here, we used exome sequencing and identified a nonsynonymous de novo mutation in BAZ1A (NM_182648.2:c.4043T > G, p.Phe1348Cys), encoding the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor 1 (ACF1), in a patient with unexplained ID.

Our results show that the patient displays decreased binding of ACF1 to the promoter of the VDR-regulated gene CYP24A1. Using RNA sequencing, we find that the mutation affects the expression of genes involved in several pathways including vitamin D metabolism, Wnt signaling and synaptic formation. RNA sequencing of BAZ1A knockdown cells and Baz1a knockout mice revealed that BAZ1A carry out distinctive functions in different tissues.

All saccharides are intimately bound through hydrogen bond, van der Waals and CH-\u03c0 interactions. Importantly, the structure of LytA is not altered upon ligand binding, whereas the bound ligand assumes a different conformation compared to the unbound NMR-based solution structure of the same PG-fragment.

Therefore, global isoform expression changes following exercise training in humans are unknown. Also, the effects of repeated interventions on transcriptional memory or training response have not been studied before. In this study, 23 individuals trained one leg for three months. Nine months later, 12 of the same subjects trained both legs in a second training period. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from both legs before and after both training periods. RNA sequencing analysis of all 119 skeletal muscle biopsies showed that training altered the expression of 3,404 gene isoforms, mainly associated with oxidative ATP production. Fifty-four genes had isoforms that changed in opposite directions. Training altered expression of 34 novel transcripts, all with protein-coding potential. After nine months of detraining, no training-induced transcriptome differences were detected between the previously trained and untrained legs. Although there were several differences in the physiological and transcriptional responses to repeated training, no coherent evidence of an endurance training induced transcriptional skeletal muscle memory was found. This human lifestyle intervention induced differential expression of thousands of isoforms and several transcripts from unannotated regions of the genome.

LTC4 is the parent molecule of the cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are recognized for their pathogenic role in asthma and allergic diseases. Cellular LTC4S activity is suppressed by PKC-mediated phosphorylation, and recently a downstream p70S6k was shown to play an important role in this process. Here, we identified Ser(36) as the major p70S6k phosphorylation site, along with a low frequency site at Thr(40), using an in vitro phosphorylation assay combined with mass spectrometry. The functional consequences of p70S6k phosphorylation were tested with the phosphomimetic mutant S36E, which displayed only about 20% (20 \u03bcmol/min/mg) of the activity of WT enzyme (95 \u03bcmol/min/mg), whereas the enzyme activity of T40E was not significantly affected. The enzyme activity of S36E increased linearly with increasing LTA4 concentrations during the steady-state kinetics analysis, indicating poor lipid substrate binding. The Ser(36) is located in a loop region close to the entrance of the proposed substrate binding pocket. Comparative molecular dynamics indicated that Ser(36) upon phosphorylation will pull the first luminal loop of LTC4S toward the neighboring subunit of the functional homotrimer, thereby forming hydrogen bonds with Arg(104) in the adjacent subunit. Because Arg(104) is a key catalytic residue responsible for stabilization of the glutathione thiolate anion, this phosphorylation-induced interaction leads to a reduction of the catalytic activity. In addition, the positional shift of the loop and its interaction with the neighboring subunit affect active site access. Thus, our mutational and kinetic data, together with molecular simulations, suggest that phosphorylation of Ser(36) inhibits the catalytic function of LTC4S by interference with the catalytic machinery.", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M116.735647", "pmid": "27365393", "labels": {"Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M116.735647"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5000086"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "2UUH"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "2UUI"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "5HV9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f00ddba0619e4b3a9feff7f71d09a120.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f00ddba0619e4b3a9feff7f71d09a120"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a8400dfd42074dea9c9ede1203978e36", "title": "Enantioselective Organocatalyzed Transformations of \u03b2-Ketoesters.", "authors": [{"family": "Govender", "given": "Thavendran", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Arvidsson", "given": "Per I", "initials": "PI"}, {"family": "Maguire", "given": "Glenn E M", "initials": "GE"}, {"family": "Kruger", "given": "Hendrik G", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Naicker", "given": "Tricia", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-24", "journal": {"volume": "116", "issn": "1520-6890", "issue": "16", "pages": "9375-9437", "title": "Chem.

Particular attention is given to the nature of the H-bonds established and the consequent occurrence of the Grotthuss mechanism of proton transfer. We find that due to their structural similarity, the imidazolium cation and the imidazole molecule behave as interchangeable and competing sites of interaction for the TFSI anion. All investigated properties, that is the phase behavior, strength of ion-ion and ion-imidazole interactions, number of specific H-bonds, density, and self-diffusivity, are composition dependent and show trend changes at mole fractions of imidazole (\u03c7) approximately equal to 0.2 and 0.5. Beyond \u03c7 = 0.8 imidazole is not miscible in C2HImTFSI at room temperature. We find that at the equimolar composition (\u03c7 \u2248 0.5) a structural transition occurs from an ionic network mainly stabilized by coulombic forces to a mixed phase held together by site specific H-bonds. The same composition also marks a steeper decrease in density and increase in diffusivity, resulting from the preference of imidazole molecules to H-bond to each other in a chain-like manner. As a result of these structural features the Grotthuss mechanism of proton transfer is less favored at the equimolar composition where H-bonds are too stable. By contrast, the Grotthuss mechanism is more pronounced in the low concentration range where imidazole acts as a base pulling the proton of the imidazolium cation.

In this article, we present the synthesis and characterization of novel self-assembled supramolecular HA and CS nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs were developed using fluorescein as a hydrophobic component that induced amphiphilicity in biopolymers and also efficiently stabilized anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) promoting a near zero-order drug release. The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies of these NPs in different human cancer lines, namely, human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 and human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 demonstrated dose dependent cytotoxicity. Interestingly, both NPs showed CD44 dependent cellular uptake with the CS-DOX NP displaying higher dose-dependent cytotoxicity than the HA-DOX NP in different mammalian cells tested. Immunological evaluation of these nanocarriers in an ex vivo human whole blood model revealed that unlike unmodified polymers, the HA NP and CS NP surprisingly showed platelet aggregation and thrombin-antithrombin complex formation at high concentrations (0.8 mg/mL). We also observed a clear difference in early- and late-stage complement activation (C3a and sC5b-9) with CS and CS NP triggering significant complement activation at high concentrations (0.08-0.8 mg/mL), unlike HA and HA NP.

In particular, the effect on the human immune system is poorly defined. Here, we describe previously unrecognized immunomodulatory activities of cinobufagin (CBG), a major bioactive component of Chan-Su. Using human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), we show that LPS-induced maturation and production of a number of cytokines was potently inhibited by CBG, which also had a pro-apoptotic effect, associated with activation of caspase-3. Interestingly, CBG triggered caspase-1 activation and significantly enhanced IL-1\u03b2 production in LPS-stimulated cells. Finally, we demonstrate that CBG upregulates gene expression of the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hBD-2 and hBD-3 in DCs, and induces secretion of HNP1-3 and hCAP-18/LL-37 from neutrophils, potentiating neutrophil antibacterial activity. Taken together, our data indicate that CBG modulates the inflammatory phenotype of DCs in response to LPS, and triggers an antibacterial innate immune response, thus proposing possible mechanisms for the clinical effects of Chan-Su in anti-infective therapy.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0160734", "pmid": "27529866", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-16-09427"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4986986"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a233f6e06473469cbaf5cdb9c7fa3533.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a233f6e06473469cbaf5cdb9c7fa3533"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c6ac13283afd4ea48ddc2b39be64df94", "title": "Cellular Barcoding Links B-1a B Cell Potential to a Fetal Hematopoietic Stem Cell State at the Single-Cell Level.", "authors": [{"family": "Kristiansen", "given": "Trine A", "initials": "TA"}, {"family": "Jaensson Gyllenb\u00e4ck", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Zriwil", "given": "Alya", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rklund", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Daniel", "given": "Jeremy A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Sitnicka", "given": "Ewa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Soneji", "given": "Shamit", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bryder", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Yuan", "given": "Joan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-16", "journal": {"volume": "45", "issn": "1097-4180", "issue": "2", "pages": "346-357", "title": "Immunity"}, "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo a functional switch in neonatal mice hallmarked by a decrease in self-renewing divisions and entry into quiescence.

The systematic change of electron density of the pyridine nitrogens upon alteration of the para-substituent (NO2, CF3, H, F, Me, OMe, NMe2) was confirmed by (15)N NMR and by computation of the natural atomic population and the \u03c0 electron population of the nitrogen atoms.

For modelling, two implementations of support vector machines (SVM) were used. Chemical structures were described by the signatures molecular descriptor.

BarR is an Lrp-like transcription factor in the model archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that activates the expression of a \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase gene, which is involved in \u03b2-alanine degradation. In contrast to classical Lrp-like transcription factors, BarR is not responsive to any of the \u03b1-amino acids but interacts specifically with \u03b2-alanine. Besides the juxtaposed \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase gene, other regulatory targets of BarR have not yet been identified although \u03b2-alanine is the precursor of coenzyme A and thus an important central metabolite. The aim of this study is to extend the knowledge of the DNA-binding characteristics of BarR and of its corresponding regulon from a local to a genome-wide perspective.\n\nWe characterized the genome-wide binding profile of BarR using chromatin immunoprecipation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). This revealed 21 genomic binding loci. High-enrichment binding regions were validated to interact with purified BarR protein in vitro using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and almost all targets were also shown to harbour a conserved semi-palindromic binding motif. Only a small subset of enriched genomic sites are located in intergenic regions at a relative short distance to a promoter, and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only one additional operon is under activation of BarR, namely the glutamine synthase operon. The latter is also a target of other Lrp-like transcription factors. Detailed inspection of the BarR ChIP-seq profile at the \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase promoter region in combination with binding motif predictions indicate that the operator structure is more complicated than previously anticipated, consisting of multiple (major and auxiliary) operators.\n\nBarR has a limited regulon, and includes also glutamine synthase genes besides the previously characterized \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase. Regulation of glutamine synthase is suggestive of a link between \u03b2-alanine and \u03b1-amino acid metabolism in S. acidocaldarius. Furthermore, this work reveals that the BarR regulon overlaps with that of other Lrp-like regulators.", "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-2890-0", "pmid": "27502941", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12864-016-2890-0"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4977709"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d20029cd97e5458ba383b2a258b01fe8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d20029cd97e5458ba383b2a258b01fe8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8876c5f453b24b0f9219968d47dde812", "title": "Stromal Hedgehog signalling is downregulated in colon cancer and its restoration restrains tumour growth.", "authors": [{"family": "Gerling", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "B\u00fcller", "given": "Nik\u00e8 V J A", "initials": "NV"}, {"family": "Kirn", "given": "Leonard M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Joost", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Frings", "given": "Oliver", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Englert", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Kuiper", "given": "Raoul V", "initials": "RV"}, {"family": "Blaas", "given": "Leander", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wielenga", "given": "Mattheus C B", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "Almer", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "K\u00fchl", "given": "Anja A", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Fredlund", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "van den Brink", "given": "Gijs R", "initials": "GR"}, {"family": "Toftg\u00e5rd", "given": "Rune", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-05", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "2041-1723", "issue": null, "pages": "12321", "title": "Nat Commun"}, "abstract": "A role for Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been proposed. In CRC and other solid tumours, Hh ligands are upregulated; however, a specific Hh antagonist provided no benefit in a clinical trial. Here we use Hh reporter mice to show that downstream Hh activity is unexpectedly diminished in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer, and that downstream Hh signalling is restricted to the stroma. Functionally, stroma-specific Hh activation in mice markedly reduces the tumour load and blocks progression of advanced neoplasms, partly via the modulation of BMP signalling and restriction of the colonic stem cell signature. By contrast, attenuated Hh signalling accelerates colonic tumourigenesis. In human CRC, downstream Hh activity is similarly reduced and canonical Hh signalling remains predominantly paracrine.

Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is regarded as the gold standard for detection of ALK rearrangements, ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) is often used as screening tool in clinical practice. In order to unbiasedly analyze the diagnostic impact of such a screening strategy, we compared ALK IHC with ALK FISH in three large representative Swedish NSCLC cohorts incorporating clinical parameters and gene expression data.\n\nALK rearrangements were detected using FISH on tissue microarrays (TMAs), including tissue from 851 NSCLC patients. In parallel, ALK protein expression was detected using IHC, applying the antibody clone D5F3 with two different protocols (the FDA approved Ventana CDx assay and our in house Dako IHC protocol). Gene expression microarray data (Affymetrix) was available for 194 patients.\n\nALK rearrangements were detected in 1.7\u00a0% in the complete cohort and 2.0\u00a0% in the non-squamous cell carcinoma subgroup. ALK protein expression was observed in 1.8 and 1.4\u00a0% when applying the Ventana assay or the in house Dako protocol, respectively. The specificity and accuracy of IHC was high (>\u200998\u00a0%), while the sensitivity was between 69\u00a0% (Ventana) and 62\u00a0% (in house Dako protocol).

genetic architecture of common traits, including the number, frequency, and effect sizes of inherited variants that contribute to individual risk, has been long debated. Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies.

Traditionally, DNA methylation has been perceived as a quite stable modification; however, lately, there have been reports of a more dynamic CpG methylation that can be affected by, for example, long-term culturing. We recently reported that methylation in the enhancer of the gene encoding the key fibrinolytic enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was rapidly erased during cell culturing. In the present study we used sub-culturing of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model of environmental challenge to examine how fast genome-wide methylation changes can arise. To assess genome-wide DNA methylation, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used on primary, passage 0, and passage 4 HUVECs. Almost 2% of the analyzed sites changed methylation status to passage 4, predominantly displaying hypomethylation. Sites annotated as enhancers were overrepresented among the differentially methylated sites (DMSs). We further showed that half of the corresponding genes concomitantly altered their expression, most of them increasing in expression. Interestingly, the stroke-related gene HDAC9 increased its expression several hundredfold. This study reveals a rapid hypomethylation of CpG sites in enhancer elements during the early stages of cell culturing. As many methods for methylation analysis are biased toward CpG rich promoter regions, we suggest that such methods may not always be appropriate for the study of methylation dynamics. In addition, we found that significant changes in expression arose in genes with enhancer DMSs. HDAC9 displayed the most prominent increase in expression, indicating, for the first time, that dynamic enhancer methylation may be central in regulating this important stroke-associated gene.", "doi": "10.1080/15592294.2016.1192734", "pmid": "27302749", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4990226"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0f760d33880c40d7a49894a781e53fbc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0f760d33880c40d7a49894a781e53fbc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4bdfcac87ec8493f923dfd3d0c64a1ea", "title": "Mutation-Induced Population Shift in the MexR Conformational Ensemble Disengages DNA Binding: A Novel Mechanism for MarR Family Derepression.", "authors": [{"family": "Anandapadamanaban", "given": "Madhanagopal", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pilst\u00e5l", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Andresen", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Trewhella", "given": "Jill", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Moche", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wallner", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Sunnerhagen", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-02", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "1878-4186", "issue": "8", "pages": "1311-1321", "title": "Structure"}, "abstract": "MexR is a repressor of the MexAB-OprM multidrug efflux pump operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where DNA-binding impairing mutations lead to multidrug resistance (MDR).

However, our extended analysis, by molecular dynamics and small-angle X-ray scattering, reveals that the mutation stabilizes a ground state that is deficient of DNA binding and is shared by both mutant and wild-type MexR, whereas the DNA-binding state is only transiently reached by the more flexible wild-type MexR. This population shift in the conformational ensemble is effected by mutation-induced allosteric coupling of contact networks that are independent in the wild-type protein.

Most described diplomonads are intestinal parasites or commensals of various animals, but there are also free-living diplomonads found in oxygen-poor environments such as marine and freshwater sediments. All these nest well within groups of parasitic diplomonads in phylogenetic trees, suggesting that they could be secondarily free-living.\n\nWe present a transcriptome study of Trepomonas sp. PC1, a diplomonad isolated from marine sediment. Analysis of the metabolic genes revealed a number of proteins involved in degradation of the bacterial membrane and cell wall, as well as an extended set of enzymes involved in carbohydrate degradation and nucleotide metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses showed that most of the differences in metabolic capacity between free-living Trepomonas and the parasitic diplomonads are due to recent acquisitions of bacterial genes via gene transfer. Interestingly, one of the acquired genes encodes a ribonucleotide reductase, which frees Trepomonas from the need to scavenge deoxyribonucleosides. The transcriptome included a gene encoding squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase. This enzyme synthesizes the sterol substitute tetrahymanol in the absence of oxygen, potentially allowing Trepomonas to thrive under anaerobic conditions as a free-living bacterivore, without depending on sterols from other eukaryotes.\n\nOur findings are consistent with the phylogenetic evidence that the last common ancestor of diplomonads was dependent on a host and that Trepomonas has adapted secondarily to a free-living lifestyle. We believe that similar studies of other groups where free-living taxa are nested within parasites could reveal more examples of secondarily free-living eukaryotes.", "doi": "10.1186/s12915-016-0284-z", "pmid": "27480115", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12915-016-0284-z"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4967989"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9541cf58b5b04ad099558fa98e9426c2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9541cf58b5b04ad099558fa98e9426c2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9dcc622ffa634ecb881934cd870a28c2", "title": "Adaptation to different types of stress converge on mitochondrial metabolism.", "authors": [{"family": "Lahtvee", "given": "Petri-Jaan", "initials": "PJ"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Rahul", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hallstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-01", "journal": {"volume": "27", "issn": "1939-4586", "issue": "15", "pages": "2505-2514", "title": "Mol.

We investigated the three most commonly encountered industrial stresses for yeast (ethanol, salt, and temperature) to identify the mechanisms of general and stress-specific responses under chemostat conditions in which specific growth rate-dependent changes are eliminated. By applying systems-level analysis, we found that most stress responses converge on mitochondrial processes. Our analysis revealed that stress-specific factors differ between applied stresses; however, they are underpinned by an increased ATP demand. We found that when ATP demand increases to high levels, respiration cannot provide sufficient ATP, leading to onset of respirofermentative metabolism. Although stress-specific factors increase ATP demand for cellular growth under stressful conditions, increased ATP demand for cellular maintenance underpins a general stress response and is responsible for the onset of overflow metabolism.", "doi": "10.1091/mbc.E16-03-0187", "pmid": "27307591", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mbc.E16-03-0187"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4966989"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9dcc622ffa634ecb881934cd870a28c2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9dcc622ffa634ecb881934cd870a28c2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b3a286d069224a51b9dc64f519db5867", "title": "MetLab: An In Silico Experimental Design, Simulation and Analysis Tool for Viral Metagenomics Studies.", "authors": [{"family": "Norling", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Karlsson-Lindsj\u00f6", "given": "Oskar E", "initials": "OE"}, {"family": "Gourl\u00e9", "given": "Hadrien", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bongcam-Rudloff", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hayer", "given": "Juliette", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-01", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "8", "pages": "e0160334", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Metagenomics, the sequence characterization of all genomes within a sample, is widely used as a virus discovery tool as well as a tool to study viral diversity of animals.

Bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic datasets is in itself a complex process, involving few standardized methodologies, thereby hampering comparison of metagenomics studies between research groups. In this publication the new bioinformatics framework MetLab is presented, aimed at providing scientists with an integrated tool for experimental design and analysis of viral metagenomes. MetLab provides support in designing the metagenomics experiment by estimating the sequencing depth needed for the complete coverage of a species. This is achieved by applying a methodology to calculate the probability of coverage using an adaptation of Stevens' theorem. It also provides scientists with several pipelines aimed at simplifying the analysis of viral metagenomes, including; quality control, assembly and taxonomic binning. We also implement a tool for simulating metagenomics datasets from several sequencing platforms. The overall aim is to provide virologists with an easy to use tool for designing, simulating and analyzing viral metagenomes.

However, details of the kinetic mechanism of 5-LOX are still obscure. In this Letter, we investigated the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 5-LOX with its physiological substrate, arachidonic acid (AA). The observed KIE is 20\u00b14 on kcat and 17\u00b12 on kcat/KM at 25\u00b0C indicating a non-classical reaction mechanism. The observed rates show slight temperature dependence at ambient temperatures ranging from 4 to 35\u00b0C. Also, we observed low Arrhenius prefactor ratio (AH/AD=0.21) and a small change in activation energy (Ea(D)-Ea(H)=3.6J/mol) which suggests that 5-LOX catalysis involves tunneling as a mechanism of H-transfer. The measured KIE for 5-LOX involves a change in regioselectivity in response to deuteration at position C7, resulting in H-abstraction form C10 and formation of 8-HETE. The viscosity experiments influence the (H)kcat, but not (D)kcat. However the overall kcat/KM is not affected for labeled or unlabeled AA, suggesting that either the product release or conformational rearrangement might be involved in dictating kinetics of 5-LOX at saturating conditions. Investigation of available crystal structures suggests the role of active site residues (F421, Q363 and L368) in regulating the donor-acceptor distances, thus affecting H-transfer as well as regiospecificity. In summary, our study shows that that the H-abstraction is the rate limiting step for 5-LOX and that the observed KIE of 5-LOX is masked by a change in regioselectivity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.06.025", "pmid": "27363940", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0960-894X(16)30636-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d8d46dfc517c4e59bc0d65cc9ef7bab9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d8d46dfc517c4e59bc0d65cc9ef7bab9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0d38d254f4fb4d36ac457584665cb411", "title": "Genome-wide association meta-analysis in Chinese and European individuals identifies ten new loci associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.", "authors": [{"family": "Morris", "given": "David L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Sheng", "given": "Yujun", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Yan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Yong-Fei", "initials": "YF"}, {"family": "Zhu", "given": "Zhengwei", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Tombleson", "given": "Philip", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Lingyan", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Cunninghame Graham", "given": "Deborah S", "initials": "DS"}, {"family": "Bentham", "given": "James", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Roberts", "given": "Amy L", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Ruoyan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Zuo", "given": "Xianbo", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Tingyou", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wen", "given": "Leilei", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Chao", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Lu", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Lulu", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Feng", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Yuanbo", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Yin", "given": "Xianyong", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Sen", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnblom", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "F\u00fcrnrohr", "given": "Barbara G", "initials": "BG"}, {"family": "Voll", "given": "Reinhard E", "initials": "RE"}, {"family": "Schett", "given": "Georg", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Costedoat-Chalumeau", "given": "Nathalie", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Gaffney", "given": "Patrick M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "Lau", "given": "Yu Lung", "initials": "YL"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Xuejun", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Wanling", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Cui", "given": "Yong", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Vyse", "given": "Timothy J", "initials": "TJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "48", "issn": "1546-1718", "issue": "8", "pages": "940-946", "title": "Nat.

Mutations in XYLT2, encoding isoform of xylosyltransferase, were recently identified as the cause of the syndrome. We report on 4 patients, 2 unrelated patients and 2 siblings, with spondyloocular syndrome and novel mutations in XYLT2. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation, NM_022167.3(XYLT2): c.2188C>T, resulting in a premature stop codon (p.Arg730*) in a female patient. The patient presents visual impairment, generalized osteoporosis, short stature with short trunk, spinal compression fractures, and increased intervertebral disc space and hearing loss. We extended our XYLT2 analysis to a cohort of 22 patients with generalized osteoporosis, mostly from consanguineous families. In this cohort, we found by Sanger sequencing 2 siblings and 1 single patient who were homozygous for missense mutations in the XYLT2 gene (p.Arg563Gly and p.Leu605Pro). The patients had osteoporosis, compression fractures, cataracts, and hearing loss. Bisphosphonate treatment in 1 patient resulted in almost complete normalization of vertebral structures by adolescence, whereas treatment response in the others was variable. This report together with a previous study shows that mutations in the XYLT2 gene result in a variable phenotype dominated by spinal osteoporosis, cataract, and hearing loss. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2834", "pmid": "26987875", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/655d9c88a16e40798a9d335394eb0836.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/655d9c88a16e40798a9d335394eb0836"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6a88e152041646e592f187ab8cda3826", "title": "Tuning fresh: radiation through rewiring of central metabolism in streamlined bacteria.", "authors": [{"family": "Eiler", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mondav", "given": "Rhiannon", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sinclair", "given": "Lucas", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Fernandez-Vidal", "given": "Leyden", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Scofield", "given": "Douglas G", "initials": "DG"}, {"family": "Schwientek", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Martinez-Garcia", "given": "Manuel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Torrents", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "McMahon", "given": "Katherine D", "initials": "KD"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Siv Ge", "initials": "SG"}, {"family": "Stepanauskas", "given": "Ramunas", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Woyke", "given": "Tanja", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bertilsson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "10", "issn": "1751-7370", "issue": "8", "pages": "1902-1914", "title": "ISME J"}, "abstract": "Most free-living planktonic cells are streamlined and in spite of their limitations in functional flexibility, their vast populations have radiated into a wide range of aquatic habitats. Here we compared the metabolic potential of subgroups in the Alphaproteobacteria lineage SAR11 adapted to marine and freshwater habitats. Our results suggest that the successful leap from marine to freshwaters in SAR11 was accompanied by a loss of several carbon degradation pathways and a rewiring of the central metabolism. Examples for these are C1 and methylated compounds degradation pathways, the Entner-Doudouroff pathway, the glyoxylate shunt and anapleuretic carbon fixation being absent from the freshwater genomes. Evolutionary reconstructions further suggest that the metabolic modules making up these important freshwater metabolic traits were already present in the gene pool of ancestral marine SAR11 populations. The loss of the glyoxylate shunt had already occurred in the common ancestor of the freshwater subgroup and its closest marine relatives, suggesting that the adaptation to freshwater was a gradual process. Furthermore, our results indicate rapid evolution of TRAP transporters in the freshwater clade involved in the uptake of low molecular weight carboxylic acids. We propose that such gradual tuning of metabolic pathways and transporters toward locally available organic substrates is linked to the formation of subgroups within the SAR11 clade and that this process was critical for the freshwater clade to find and fix an adaptive phenotype.", "doi": "10.1038/ismej.2015.260", "pmid": "26784354", "labels": {"Microbial Single Cell Genomics":

There is some debate about whether migraine is a disease of vascular dysfunction or a result of neuronal dysfunction with secondary vascular changes. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have thus far identified 13 independent loci associated with migraine. To identify new susceptibility loci, we carried out a genetic study of migraine on 59,674 affected subjects and 316,078 controls from 22 GWA studies. We identified 44 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with migraine risk (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) that mapped to 38 distinct genomic loci, including 28 loci not previously reported and a locus that to our knowledge is the first to be identified on chromosome X. In subsequent computational analyses, the identified loci showed enrichment for genes expressed in vascular and smooth muscle tissues, consistent with a predominant theory of migraine that highlights vascular etiologies.", "doi": "10.1038/ng.3598", "pmid": "27322543", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs":

The proportion of BMI variation explained by additive genetic factors was lowest at 4 y of age in boys (a(2) = 0.42) and girls (a(2) = 0.41) and then generally increased to 0.75 in both sexes at 19 y of age. This was because of a stronger influence of environmental factors shared by co-twins in midchildhood. After 15 y of age, the effect of shared environment was not observed. The sex-specific expression of genetic factors was seen in infancy but was most prominent at 13 y of age and older. The variance of BMI was highest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation to total variation remained roughly similar across different regions.\n\nEnvironmental factors shared by co-twins affect BMI in childhood, but little evidence for their contribution was found in late adolescence.

The early face appears to be built from multiple spatially defined overlapping ectomesenchymal clones. During early face development, these clones remain oligopotent and generate various tissues in a given location. By combining clonal analysis, computer simulations, mouse mutants, and live imaging, we show that facial shaping results from an array of local cellular activities in the ectomesenchyme. These activities mostly involve oriented divisions and crowd movements of cells during morphogenetic events. Cellular behavior that can be recognized as individual cell migration is very limited and short-ranged and likely results from cellular mixing due to the proliferation activity of the tissue. These cellular mechanisms resemble the strategy behind limb bud morphogenesis, suggesting the possibility of common principles and deep homology between facial and limb outgrowth.", "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1600060", "pmid": "27493992", "labels": {"Advanced Light Microscopy (ALM)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1600060"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4972470"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/993f8ce2d05b4f62b7966bf6f4196c5d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/993f8ce2d05b4f62b7966bf6f4196c5d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9b7e9f8ea973458aa258683e955aaa1c", "title": "Transcriptomic analysis reveals how a lack of potassium ions increases Sulfolobus acidocaldarius sensitivity to pH changes.", "authors": [{"family": "Buetti-Dinh", "given": "Antoine", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dethlefsen", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Friedman", "given": "Ran", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Dopson", "given": "Mark", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "162", "issn": "1465-2080", "issue": "8", "pages": "1422-1434", "title": "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)"}, "abstract": "Extremely acidophilic microorganisms (optimum growth pH of \u22643) maintain a near neutral cytoplasmic pH via several homeostatic mechanisms, including an inside positive membrane potential created by potassium ions.

The mechanisms are likely multiple since different progestins interact with other steroid receptors in addition to progesterone receptors. Puberty is the process when animals first acquire the capability to reproduce and it comprises maturation of sperm and eggs. In zebrafish, puberty is initiated around 45days post fertilization (dpf) in females and around 53-55 dpf in males, and is marked by increased production of pituitary gonadotropins. We exposed juvenile zebrafish from 20 to 80 dpf to the androgenic progestin levonorgestrel at concentrations of 5.5, 79 and 834ngL(-1) and to the non-androgenic progestin progesterone at concentrations of 3.7, 77 and 1122ngL(-1), during sexual differentiation and puberty. Levonorgestrel exposure caused 100% males even at the lowest concentration tested whereas progesterone did not affect the sex ratio. Transcript levels of the gonadal genes amh, CYP11B and CYP19a1a indicated that the masculinizing effect of levonorgestrel occurred very rapidly. Transcript concentrations of gonadotropins in pituitaries were low in control fish at 44 dpf, but high at 55 dpf and onward. In fish exposed to levonorgestrel or progesterone gonadotropin transcript concentrations were high already at 44 dpf, indicating that both progestins caused precocious puberty.

Experimental NMR measurements target conformationally sensitive parameters, including J couplings and effective distances around the glycosidic linkages, while the computational simulations apply the well-calibrated additive CHARMM carbohydrate force field in combination with efficient enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation methods. Analysis of conformational heterogeneity is performed based on sampling of discreet states as defined by dihedral angles, on root-mean-square differences of Cartesian coordinates and on the extent of volume sampled. Conformational clustering, based on the glycosidic linkage dihedral angles, shows that accounting for the full range of sampled conformations is required to reproduce the experimental data, emphasizing the utility of the molecular simulations in obtaining an atomic detailed description of the conformational properties of the saccharides. Results show the presence of differential conformational preferences as a function of primary sequence and glycosidic linkage types. Significant differences in conformational ensembles associated with the anomeric configuration of a single glycosidic linkage reinforce the impact of such changes on the conformational properties of carbohydrates.

We discuss the novel and unique features of the final cell cycle of horizontal cell progenitors and how they may relate to retinoblastoma carcinogenesis.", "doi": "10.3389/fnana.2016.00077", "pmid": "27486389", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4949263"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f02e8ba841f4f6a9b6f2ebe1e662291.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f02e8ba841f4f6a9b6f2ebe1e662291"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cfdd15c7d1904ce192df0182dbe98a14", "title": "DNA Content in Extracellular Vesicles Isolated from Porcine Coronary Venous Blood Directly after Myocardial Ischemic Preconditioning.", "authors": [{"family": "Svennerholm", "given": "Kristina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Rodsand", "given": "Pouria", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hellman", "given": "Urban", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Waldenstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lundholm", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ahr\u00e9n", "given": "Dag", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Biber", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Ronquist", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Haney", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-07-19", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "7", "pages": "e0159105", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nano-sized membranous structures released from most cells.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) coactivators are not only among the genes differentially induced by distinct training methods, but they also participate in the ensuing signaling cascades that allow skeletal muscle to adapt to each type of exercise. Although endurance training preferentially induces PGC-1\u03b11 expression, resistance exercise activates the expression of PGC-1\u03b12, -\u03b13, and -\u03b14. These three alternative PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms lack the arginine/serine-rich (RS) and RNA recognition motifs characteristic of PGC-1\u03b11. Discrete functions for PGC-1\u03b11 and -\u03b14 have been described, but the biological role of PGC-1\u03b12 and -\u03b13 remains elusive. Here we show that different PGC-1\u03b1 variants can affect target gene splicing through diverse mechanisms, including alternative promoter usage. By analyzing the exon structure of the target transcripts for each PGC-1\u03b1 isoform, we were able to identify a large number of previously unknown PGC-1\u03b12 and -\u03b13 target genes and pathways in skeletal muscle. In particular, PGC-1\u03b12 seems to mediate a decrease in the levels of cholesterol synthesis genes. Our results suggest that the conservation of the N-terminal activation and repression domains (and not the RS/RNA recognition motif) is what determines the gene programs and splicing options modulated by each PGC-1\u03b1 isoform. By using skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice for PGC-1\u03b11 and -\u03b14, we could validate, in vivo, splicing events observed in in vitro studies.

Although this mutant has been analysed extensively to investigate mesoderm diversification and differentiation and continues to be broadly used as a unique avascular model, the isolation of the cloche gene has been challenging due to its telomeric location. Here we used a deletion allele of cloche to identify several new cloche candidate genes within this genomic region, and systematically genome-edited each candidate. Through this comprehensive interrogation, we succeeded in isolating the cloche gene and discovered that it encodes a PAS-domain-containing bHLH transcription factor, and that it is expressed in a highly specific spatiotemporal pattern starting during late gastrulation. Gain-of-function experiments show that it can potently induce endothelial gene expression. Epistasis experiments reveal that it functions upstream of etv2 and tal1, the earliest expressed endothelial and haematopoietic transcription factor genes identified to date. A mammalian cloche orthologue can also rescue blood vessel formation in zebrafish cloche mutants, indicating a highly conserved role in vertebrate vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis.

We applied a tailored network-based approach to identify signaling hubs associated with regulation of this part of metabolism. Using transcriptomics data of HCC patients, we identified significant dysregulated expressions of lipid-regulated genes, across many different lipid metabolic pathways. Our findings, however, show that viral hepatitis causes HCC by a distinct mechanism, less likely involving lipid anomalies.

We screened for polymorphisms where the cases and the control pool were fixed for opposite alleles and observed this signature for only 25 SNPs, most of which were scattered on genome assembly unassigned scaffolds. Read depth analysis at these loci revealed homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two partially overlapping large deletions in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of chromosome X/Y in cases but not in the control pool. One of these deletions removes the entire coding region of the SHOX gene and both deletions remove parts of the CRLF2 gene located downstream of SHOX. The horse reference assembly of the PAR is highly fragmented, and in order to characterize this region we sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. This considerably improved the assembly and enabled size estimations of the two deletions to 160-180 kb and 60-80 kb, respectively.

We here present data from the first microbial community-wide metacaspase survey; performed by querying metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from the brackish Baltic Sea, a water body characterized by pronounced environmental gradients and periods of massive cyanobacterial blooms. Metacaspase genes were restricted to ~4% of the bacteria, taxonomically affiliated mainly to Bacteroidetes, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. The gene abundance was significantly higher in larger or particle-associated bacteria (>0.8 \u03bcm), and filamentous Cyanobacteria dominated metacaspase gene expression throughout the bloom season. Distinct seasonal expression patterns were detected for the three metacaspase genes in Nodularia spumigena, one of the main bloom-formers. Clustering of normalized gene expression in combination with analyses of genomic and assembly data suggest functional diversification of these genes, and possible roles of the metacaspase genes related to stress responses, i.e., sulfur metabolism in connection to oxidative stress, and nutrient stress induced cellular differentiation. Co-expression of genes encoding metacaspases and nodularin toxin synthesis enzymes was also observed in Nodularia spumigena.

Semi-quantitative and digital-image-analyses-based scoring of the NORDIC-VII cohort identified significant associations between low expression of perivascular PDGFR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 and shorter overall survival. Analyses of the SPCRC cohort confirmed these findings. Perivascular PDGFR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 remained independent factors for survival in multivariate analyses.Overall, our study identified host vasculature and oncogenic status as determinants of tumor perivascular features. Perivascular PDGFR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 were identified as novel independent markers predicting survival in mCRC.

Monocytes were used as representative cells of the innate immune system. The underlying hypothesis was that their proteome response to different activating molecules would reflect the immunogenicity of these molecules. To identify the main modes of response, we treated the human monocytic THP-1 cell line with nine different stimuli. Differentiation and activation were determined to be the two major modes of monocyte response, with PMA causing the strongest differentiation and Pam3CSK4 causing the strongest proinflammatory activation. The established assay was applied to characterize the monocyte response to epidermal growth factor peptide containing isoaspartate, which induced differentiation but not proinflammatory activation.

In addition, existing feature detection algorithms commonly suffer from compatibility issues, long computation times, or poor performance on high-resolution data.

Dinosaur has the functionality to sample algorithm computations through quality-control plots, which we call a plot trail.

In a GWAS, the effects of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) need to be fitted and any model development is constrained by the computational requirements. A method is therefore required that can fit a highly hierarchical model and at the same time is computationally fast enough to be useful.Our method fits fixed SNP effects in a linear mixed model that can include both random polygenic effects and permanent environmental effects. In this way, the model can correct for population structure and model repeated measures. The covariance structure of the linear mixed model is first estimated and subsequently used in a generalized least squares setting to fit the SNP effects. The method was evaluated in a simulation study based on observed genotypes from a long-term study of collared flycatchers in Sweden.The method we present here was successful in estimating permanent environmental effects from simulated repeated measures data. Additionally, we found that especially for variable phenotypes having large variation between years, the repeated measurements model has a substantial increase in power compared to a model using average phenotypes as a response.The method is available in the r package RepeatABEL.

Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is one of just two polyploid conifer species and the only hexaploid. Evidence from fossil guard cell size suggests that polyploidy in Sequoia dates to the Eocene. Numerous hypotheses about the mechanism of polyploidy and parental genome donors have been proposed, based primarily on morphological and cytological data, but it remains unclear how Sequoia became polyploid and why this lineage overcame an apparent gymnosperm barrier to whole-genome duplication (WGD). We sequenced transcriptomes and used phylogenetic inference, Bayesian concordance analysis and paralog age distributions to resolve relationships among gene copies in hexaploid coast redwood and close relatives. Our data show that hexaploidy in coast redwood is best explained by autopolyploidy or, if there was allopolyploidy, it happened within the Californian redwood clade. We found that duplicate genes have more similar sequences than expected, given the age of the inferred polyploidization. Conflict between molecular and fossil estimates of WGD can be explained if diploidization occurred very slowly following polyploidization.

In particular, as SNPs are often developed from transcriptomes, parameters relating to the genomic context are rarely taken into account. Here, we assembled a draft Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) genome (assembly size: 2.41\u00a0Gb; scaffold/contig N50 : 3.1\u00a0Mb/27.5\u00a0kb). We then used this resource to map the probe sequences of 144 putative SNPs genotyped in 480 individuals. The number of probe-to-genome mappings and alignment length together explained almost a third of the variation in validation success, indicating that sequence uniqueness and proximity to intron-exon boundaries play an important role. The same pattern was found after mapping the probe sequences to the Walrus and Weddell seal genomes, suggesting that the genomes of species divergent by as much as 23 million years can hold information relevant to SNP validation outcomes. Additionally, reanalysis of genotyping data from seven previous studies found the same two variables to be significantly associated with SNP validation success across a variety of taxa.

Notably, the binding pattern of the general NSC transcription factor SOX2 is also largely cell type specific and coincides with an enrichment of LHX2 motifs in the cortex and HOXA9 motifs in the spinal cord. Interestingly, in a zebrafish reporter gene system, these motifs were critical determinants of patterned gene expression along the rostral-caudal axis. Our findings establish a predictive model for patterned NSC gene expression, whereby domain-specific expression of LHX2 and HOX proteins act on their target motifs within commonly accessible cis-regulatory regions to specify SOX2 binding.

Our group has described an ouabain-activated Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signalosome, which protects from apoptosis. Here we show that albumin uptake in primary rat renal epithelial cells is accompanied by a time- and dose-dependent mitochondrial accumulation of the apoptotic factor Bax, down-regulation of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-xL and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Ouabain opposes these effects and protects from apoptosis in albumin-exposed proximal tubule cells and podocytes. The efficacy of ouabain as an antiapoptotic and kidney-protective therapeutic tool was then tested in rats with passive Heymann nephritis, a model of proteinuric chronic kidney disease. Chronic ouabain treatment preserved renal function, protected from renal cortical apoptosis, up-regulated Bax, down-regulated Bcl-xL, and rescued from glomerular tubular disconnection and podocyte loss.

Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin B (CSTB) underlie EPM1. The deficiency of CSTB in mice (Cstb-/- mice) generates a phenotype resembling the symptoms of EPM1 patients and is accompanied by microglial activation at two weeks of age and an upregulation of immune system-associated genes in the cerebellum at one month of age. To shed light on molecular pathways and processes linked to CSTB deficiency in microglia we characterized the transcriptome of cultured Cstb-/- mouse microglia using microarray hybridization and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The gene expression profiles obtained with these two techniques were in good accordance and not polarized to either pro- or anti-inflammatory status. In Cstb-/- microglia, altogether 184 genes were differentially expressed. Of these, 33 genes were identified by both methods. Several interferon-regulated genes were weaker expressed in Cstb-/- microglia compared to control. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR of the transcripts Irf7 and Stat1. Subsequently, we explored the biological context of CSTB deficiency in microglia more deeply by functional enrichment and canonical pathway analysis. This uncovered a potential role for CSTB in chemotaxis, antigen-presentation, and in immune- and defense response-associated processes by altering JAK-STAT pathway signaling. These data support and expand the previously suggested involvement of inflammatory processes to the disease pathogenesis of EPM1 and connect CSTB deficiency in microglia to altered expression of interferon-regulated genes.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0158195", "pmid": "27355630", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-16-07020"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4927094"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6f932dccf8b4bb4a64eb3a49f866e97.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6f932dccf8b4bb4a64eb3a49f866e97"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7f184b2951e849249cd85c696ebbe9df", "title": "Conserved 33-kb haplotype in the MHC class III region regulates chronic arthritis.", "authors": [{"family": "Yau", "given": "Anthony C Y", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Tuncel", "given": "Jonatan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Haag", "given": "Sabrina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Norin", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Houtman", "given": "Miranda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Padyukov", "given": "Leonid", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Holmdahl", "given": "Rikard", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-28", "journal": {"volume": "113", "issn": "1091-6490", "issue": "26", "pages": "E3716-E3724", "title": "Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A."}, "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have revealed many genetic loci associated with complex autoimmune diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the MHC gene HLA-DRB1 is the strongest candidate predicting disease development. It has been suggested that other immune-regulating genes in the MHC contribute to the disease risk, but this contribution has been difficult to show because of the strong linkage disequilibrium within the MHC. We isolated genomic regions in the form of congenic fragments in rats to test whether there are additional susceptibility loci in the MHC. By both congenic mapping in inbred strains and SNP typing in wild rats, we identified a conserved, 33-kb large haplotype Ltab-Ncr3 in the MHC-III region, which regulates the onset, severity, and chronicity of arthritis. The Ltab-Ncr3 haplotype consists of five polymorphic immunoregulatory genes: Lta (lymphotoxin-\u03b1), Tnf, Ltb (lymphotoxin-\u03b2), Lst1 (leukocyte-specific transcript 1), and Ncr3 (natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor 3). Significant correlation in the expression of the Ltab-Ncr3 genes suggests that interaction of these genes may be important in keeping these genes clustered together as a conserved haplotype. We studied the arthritis association and the spliceo-transcriptome of four different Ltab-Ncr3 haplotypes and showed that higher Ltb and Ncr3 expression, lower Lst1 expression, and the expression of a shorter splice variant of Lst1 correlate with reduced arthritis severity in rats. Interestingly, patients with mild RA also showed higher NCR3 expression and lower LST1 expression than patients with severe RA. These data demonstrate the importance of a conserved haplotype in the regulation of complex diseases such as arthritis.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1600567113", "pmid": "27303036", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1600567113"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4932949"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f184b2951e849249cd85c696ebbe9df.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f184b2951e849249cd85c696ebbe9df"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "97d259ee9d6047f5bbafe84bc41b97bc", "title": "PRECOG: a tool for automated extraction and visualization of fitness components in microbial growth phenomics.", "authors": [{"family": "Fernandez-Ricaud", "given": "Luciano", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kourtchenko", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Zackrisson", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Warringer", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Blomberg", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-23", "journal": {"volume": "17", "issn": "1471-2105", "issue": null, "pages": "249", "title": "BMC Bioinformatics"}, "abstract": "Phenomics is a field in functional genomics that records variation in organismal phenotypes in the genetic, epigenetic or environmental context at a massive scale.

Serotonin plays a role in embryogenesis, and serotonin transporters are expressed in two-cell mouse embryos. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether fluoxetine, one of the most prescribed SSRI antidepressant world-wide, exposure influences the timing of different embryo developmental stages, and furthermore, to analyze what protein, and protein networks, are affected by fluoxetine in the early embryo development. Human embryos (n = 48) were randomly assigned to treatment with 0.25 or 0.5 \u03bcM fluoxetine in culture medium. Embryo development was evaluated by time-lapse monitoring. The fluoxetine-induced human embryo proteome was analyzed by shotgun mass spectrometry. Protein secretion from fluoxetine-exposed human embryos was analyzed by use of high-multiplex immunoassay. The lower dose of fluoxetine had no influence on embryo development. A trend toward reduced time between thawing and start of cavitation was noted in embryos treated with 0.5 \u03bcM fluoxetine (p = 0.065). Protein analysis by shotgun mass spectrometry detected 45 proteins that were uniquely expressed in fluoxetine-treated embryos. These proteins are involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, and inflammatory response.

Our data reveal that polycomb-mediated H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is preferentially localized to regions that are targeted by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME), mechanistically linking DNA hypomethylation to imprinted gene expression.

In this study we identified salinomycin (SAL) as a potent inhibitor of autophagy and cytotoxic agent effective on several cancer cell lines under conditions of transient and chronic acidosis. Since SAL has been reported to specifically target cancer-stem cells (CSC), we used an established model of breast CSC and CSC derived from breast cancer patients to examine whether this specificity may be associated with autophagy inhibition. We indeed found that CSC-like cells are more sensitive to autophagy inhibition compared to cells not expressing CSC markers.

We tested here a hypothesis that men with LOY are more susceptible to AD and show that LOY is associated with AD in three independent studies of different types. In a case-control study, males with AD diagnosis had higher degree of LOY mosaicism (adjusted odds ratio = 2.80, p = 0.0184, AD events = 606).

This study explored the effects of an acute aerobic exercise bout on the transcriptional response to subsequent resistance exercise. Ten moderately trained men performed \u223c45 min cycling on one leg followed by 4 \u00d7 7 maximal knee extensions for each leg, 15 min later. Thus, one limb performed aerobic and resistance exercise (AE + RE) while the opposing leg did resistance exercise only (RE).

Using DNA microarray, we analyzed differences [\u22651.5-fold, false discovery rate (FDR) \u226410%] in gene expression profiles for the two modes of exercise. There were 176 genes up (127)- or downregulated (49) by AE + RE compared with RE. Among the most significant differentially expressed genes were established markers for muscle growth and oxidative capacity, novel cytokines, transcription factors, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). The most enriched functional categories were those linked to carbohydrate metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Upstream analysis revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor, cAMP-response element-binding protein, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase, and mammalian target of rapamycin were regulators highly activated by AE + RE, whereas JnK, NF-\u03ba\u03b2, MAPK, and several miRNAs were inhibited. Thus, aerobic exercise alters the skeletal muscle transcriptional signature of resistance exercise to initiate important gene programs promoting both myofiber growth and improved oxidative capacity.

Expansion of M1 macrophages in vivo enhanced the recruitment and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells to tumors, inhibiting their growth.

Intracellular oxidative stress causes the translocation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic family member, to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) where it induces membrane permeabilization. Oxidized phospholipids (OxPls) generated in the MOM during oxidative stress directly affect the onset and progression of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Here we use MOM-mimicking lipid vesicles doped with varying concentrations of 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC), an OxPl species known to significantly enhance Bax-membrane association, to investigate three key aspects of Bax's action at the MOM: 1) induction of Bax pores in membranes without additional mediator proteins, 2) existence of a threshold OxPl concentration required for Bax-membrane action and 3) mechanism by which PazePC disturbs membrane organization to facilitate Bax penetration. Fluorescence leakage studies revealed that Bax-induced leakage, especially its rate, increased with the vesicles' PazePC content without any detectable threshold neither for OxPl nor Bax. Moreover, the leakage rate correlated with the Bax to lipid ratio and the PazePC content. Solid state NMR studies and calorimetric experiments on the lipid vesicles confirmed that OxPl incorporation disrupted the membrane's organization, enabling Bax to penetrate into the membrane.

We show that REC8 foci are separated from each other by a distance smaller than 15% of the total chromosome axis length in wild-type meiocytes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in ethnic Chinese people in Taiwan and Hong Kong have shown an association between agranulocytosis induced by antithyroid drugs and the HLA alleles HLA-B*38:02 and HLA-DRB1*08:03. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis in a white European population.\n\nWe did a GWAS in 234 European adults with any non-chemotherapy drug-induced agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count \u22640\u00b75\u2008\u00d7\u200810(9)/L [\u2264500/\u03bcL]) and 5170 population controls. 39 of the 234 patients had agranulocytosis that was induced by antithyroid drugs (thiamazole [methimazole], carbimazole, or propylthiouracil). After imputation and HLA allele prediction, 9\u2008380\u2008034 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 180 HLA alleles were tested for association. The genome-wide significance threshold was p<5\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-8).\n\nAgranulocytosis induced by non-chemotherapy drugs in general was significantly associated with the HLA region on chromosome 6, with odds ratios (ORs) of 3\u00b724 (95% CI 2\u00b731-4\u00b755, p=1\u00b720\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-11)) for HLA-B*27:05 and 3\u00b757 (2\u00b761-4\u00b790, p=2\u00b732\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-15)) for the top SNP (rs114291795). Drug-specific analysis showed that the association with HLA-B*27:05 was largely driven by cases induced by antithyroid drugs. In a multiple logistic regression model, the OR for HLA-B*27:05 was 7\u00b730 (3\u00b781-13\u00b796) when antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis was compared with population controls (p=1\u00b791\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-9)) and 16\u00b791 (3\u00b744-83\u00b717) when compared with a small group of hyperthyroid controls (p=5\u00b704\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-4)). Three SNPs were strongly associated with antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis: rs652888 (OR 4\u00b773, 95% CI 3\u00b700-7\u00b744, p=1\u00b792\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-11)) and rs199564443 (17\u00b742, 7\u00b738-41\u00b712, p=7\u00b704\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-11)), which were independent of HLA-B*27:05, and rs1071816 (5\u00b727, 3\u00b706-9\u00b710, p=2\u00b735\u2008\u00d7\u200810(-9)) which was in moderate linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*27:05. In heterozygous carriers of all three SNPs, the predicted probability of antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis was about 30% (OR 753, 95% CI 105-6812). To avoid one case of agranulocytosis, based on the possible risk reduction if all three SNPs are genotyped and carriers are treated or monitored differently from non-carriers, roughly 238 patients would need to be genotyped.\n\nIn white European people, antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis was associated with HLA-B*27:05 and with other SNPs on chromosome 6. In the future, carriers of these variants could be placed under intensified monitoring or offered alternative treatment for hyperthyroidism.\n\nSwedish Research Council, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Clinical Research Support at Uppsala University, German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, Carlos III Spanish Health Institute, European Regional Development Fund, UK National Institute for Health Research, The Selander's Foundation, Thur\u00e9us Foundation, European Commission, and Science for Life Laboratory.", "doi": "10.1016/S2213-8587(16)00113-3", "pmid": "27157822", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Collaborative", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2213-8587(16)00113-3"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7ac175c461c64fab839d6d251fe9a5ac.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7ac175c461c64fab839d6d251fe9a5ac"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "88049b80ff79411bbb7001700e6faa31", "title": "Epigenomics of Total Acute Sleep Deprivation in Relation to Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiles and RNA Expression.", "authors": [{"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Emil K", "initials": "EK"}, {"family": "Bostr\u00f6m", "given": "Adrian E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Mwinyi", "given": "Jessica", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schi\u00f6th", "given": "Helgi B", "initials": "HB"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "20", "issn": "1557-8100", "issue": "6", "pages": "334-342", "title": "OMICS"}, "abstract": "Despite an established link between sleep deprivation and epigenetic processes in humans, it remains unclear to what extent sleep deprivation modulates DNA methylation. We performed a within-subject randomized blinded study with 16 healthy subjects to examine the effect of one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the genome-wide methylation profile in blood compared with that in normal sleep. Genome-wide differences in methylation between both conditions were assessed by applying a paired regression model that corrected for monocyte subpopulations. In addition, the correlations between the methylation of genes detected to be modulated by TSD and gene expression were examined in a separate, publicly available cohort of 10 healthy male donors (E-GEOD-49065). Sleep deprivation significantly affected the DNA methylation profile both independently and in dependency of shifts in monocyte composition. Our study detected differential methylation of 269 probes. Notably, one CpG site was located 69\u2009bp upstream of ING5, which has been shown to be differentially expressed after sleep deprivation. Gene set enrichment analysis detected the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways to be enriched among the differentially methylated genes. These results provide evidence that total acute sleep deprivation alters the methylation profile in healthy human subjects. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that systematically investigated the impact of total acute sleep deprivation on genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in blood and related the epigenomic findings to the expression data.", "doi": "10.1089/omi.2016.0041", "pmid": "27310475", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4926204"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/88049b80ff79411bbb7001700e6faa31.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/88049b80ff79411bbb7001700e6faa31"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "afdf49e9691a456abafd53faf795ccfc", "title": "Coxsackievirus counters the host innate immune response by blocking type III interferon expression.", "authors": [{"family": "Lind", "given": "Katharina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Svedin", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Domsgen", "given": "Erna", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kapell", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Laitinen", "given": "Olli", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Moll", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Flodstr\u00f6m-Tullberg", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "97", "issn": "1465-2099", "issue": "6", "pages": "1-12", "title": "J.

Their importance is underscored by observations showing that many enteroviruses including coxsackie B viruses (CVBs) have developed strategies to block type I IFN production. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the type III IFNs (also called IFN\u03bbs) in reducing permissiveness to infections with enteric viruses including coxsackievirus. However, whether or not CVBs have measures to evade the effects of type III IFNs remains unknown. By combining virus infection studies and different modes of administrating the dsRNA mimic poly I : C, we discovered that CVBs target both TLR3- and MDA5/RIG-I-mediated type III IFN expression. Consistent with this, the cellular protein expression levels of the signal transduction proteins TRIF and IPS1 were reduced and no hyperphosphorylation of IRF-3 was observed following infection with the virus. Notably, decreased expression of full-length TRIF and IPS1 and the appearance of cleavage products was observed upon both CVB3 infection and in cellular protein extracts incubated with recombinant 2Apro, indicating an important role for the viral protease in subverting the cellular immune system. Collectively, our study reveals that CVBs block the expression of type III IFNs, and that this is achieved by a similar mechanism as the virus uses to block type I IFN production. We also demonstrate that the virus blocks several intracellular viral recognition pathways of importance for both type I and III IFN production. The simultaneous targeting of numerous arms of the host immune response may be required for successful viral replication and dissemination.", "doi": "10.1099/jgv.0.000443", "pmid": "26935471",

Recent studies indicate that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the expression of fatigue, a prominent feature of primary SS (pSS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation profiles of whole blood are associated with fatigue in patients with pSS.\n\nForty-eight pSS patients with high (n = 24) or low (n = 24) fatigue as measured by a visual analogue scale were included. Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After quality control, a total of 383 358 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites remained for further analysis. Age, sex and differential cell count estimates were included as covariates in the association model. A false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05 was considered significant, and a cut-off of 3% average difference in methylation levels between high- and low-fatigue patients was applied.\n\nA total of 251 differentially methylated CpG sites were associated with fatigue. The CpG site with the most pronounced hypomethylation in pSS high fatigue annotated to the SBF2-antisense RNA1 gene. The most distinct hypermethylation was observed at a CpG site annotated to the lymphotoxin alpha gene. Functional pathway analysis of genes with differently methylated CpG sites in subjects with high vs low fatigue revealed enrichment in several pathways associated with innate and adaptive immunity.\n\nSome genes involved in regulation of the immune system and in inflammation are differently methylated in pSS patients with high vs low fatigue.

Yet, quantitative data on fitness components are scarce, and the resulting population genetic consequences are poorly understood. Migratory divides, hybrid zones with a transition in migratory behaviour, provide a natural setting to investigate the micro-evolutionary dynamics induced by migration under sympatric conditions. Here, we studied the effects of migratory programme on survival, trait evolution and genome-wide patterns of population differentiation in a migratory divide of European barn swallows. We sampled a total of 824 individuals from both allopatric European populations wintering in central and southern Africa, respectively, along with two mixed populations from within the migratory divide. While most morphological characters varied by latitude consistent with Bergmann's rule, wing length co-varied with distance to wintering grounds. Survival data collected during a 5-year period provided strong evidence that this covariance is repeatedly generated by disruptive selection against intermediate phenotypes. Yet, selection-induced divergence did not translate into genome-wide genetic differentiation as assessed by microsatellites, mtDNA and >20\u00a0000 genome-wide SNP markers; nor did we find evidence of local genomic selection between migratory types. Among breeding populations, a single outlier locus mapped to the BUB1 gene with a role in mitotic and meiotic organization. Overall, this study provides evidence for an adaptive response to variation in migration behaviour continuously eroded by gene flow under current conditions of nonassortative mating. It supports the theoretical prediction that population differentiation is difficult to achieve under conditions of gene flow despite measurable disruptive selection.", "doi": "10.1111/mec.13521", "pmid": "26749140", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KU207441"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KU207731"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/cd2a987b6f8b480e8eaf33319ddd3d85.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/cd2a987b6f8b480e8eaf33319ddd3d85"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d568cd006f4349dc8a8fd1a6f7290215", "title": "Single Chain Antibodies as Tools to Study transforming growth factor-\u03b2-Regulated SMAD Proteins in Proximity Ligation-Based Pharmacological Screens.", "authors": [{"family": "Blokzijl", "given": "Andries", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zieba", "given": "Agata", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hust", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schirrmann", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Helmsing", "given": "Saskia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Grannas", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Hertz", "given": "Ellen", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Moren", "given": "Anita", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Lei", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derberg", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Moustakas", "given": "Aristidis", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "D\u00fcbel", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1535-9484", "issue": "6", "pages": "1848-1856", "title": "Mol.

Accordingly, there is a great need to increase the repertoire of drug treatments from which combinations may be selected to efficiently target sets of pathological processes, while suppressing the emergence of resistance mutations. In this regard, members of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway may furnish new, valuable therapeutic targets. In the present work, we developed in situ proximity ligation assays (isPLA) to monitor the state of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Moreover, we extended the range of suitable affinity reagents for this analysis by developing a set of in-vitro-derived human antibody fragments (single chain fragment variable, scFv) that bind SMAD2 (Mothers against decapentaplegic 2), 3, 4, and 7 using phage display. These four proteins are all intracellular mediators of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. We also developed an scFv specific for SMAD3 phosphorylated in the linker domain 3 (p179 SMAD3). This phosphorylation has been shown to inactivate the tumor suppressor function of SMAD3. The single chain affinity reagents developed in the study were fused tocrystallizable antibody fragments (Fc-portions) and expressed as dimeric IgG-like molecules having Fc domains (Yumabs), and we show that they represent valuable reagents for isPLA.Using these novel assays, we demonstrate that p179 SMAD3 forms a complex with SMAD4 at increased frequency during division and that pharmacological inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)(1) reduces the levels of p179SMAD3 in tumor cells. We further show that the p179SMAD3-SMAD4 complex is bound for degradation by the proteasome. Finally, we developed a chemical screening strategy for compounds that reduce the levels of p179SMAD3 in tumor cells with isPLA as a read-out, using the p179SMAD3 scFv SH544-IIC4. The screen identified two kinase inhibitors, known inhibitors of the insulin receptor, which decreased levels of p179SMAD3/SMAD4 complexes, thereby demonstrating the suitability of the recombinant affinity reagents applied in isPLA in screening for inhibitors of cell signaling.", "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M115.055756", "pmid": "26929218", "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M115.055756"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5083110"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d568cd006f4349dc8a8fd1a6f7290215.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d568cd006f4349dc8a8fd1a6f7290215"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d6566bda63754a63b60586649f4d755f", "title": "GPR44 is a pancreatic protein restricted to the human beta cell.", "authors": [{"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m-Lindahl", "given": "Ewa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Danielsson", "given": "Angelika", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Czernichow", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Korsgren", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "53", "issn": "1432-5233", "issue": "3", "pages": "413-421", "title": "Acta Diabetol"}, "abstract": "To address questions regarding onset and progression of types 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D/T2D), surrogate imaging biomarkers for beta cell function and mass are needed.

Flies with a constitutively active gut immune system, due to a mutation in the POU transcriptional regulator Pdm1/nubbin (nub) gene, had higher loads of bacteria and a more diverse taxonomic composition than controls. In addition, the microbial composition shifted considerably during the short lifespan of the nub1 mutants. This shift was characterized by a loss of relatively few OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and a remarkable increase in a large number of Acetobacter spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Treating nub1 mutant flies with antibiotics prolonged their lifetime survival by more than 100%. Immune gene expression was also persistently high in the presence of antibiotics, indicating that the early death was not a direct consequence of an overactive immune defense but rather an indirect consequence of the microbial load and composition. Thus, changes in host genotype and an inability to regulate the normal growth and composition of the gut microbiota leads to a shift in the microbial community, dysbiosis and early death.", "doi": "10.1159/000446368", "pmid": "27231014", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "000446368"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/983e3dc201174745abf9b9631372f639.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/983e3dc201174745abf9b9631372f639"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1f569b02fad4412093fb86a85265123f", "title": "Thermotolerant yeasts selected by adaptive evolution express heat stress response at 30\u2009\u00b0C.", "authors": [{"family": "Caspeta", "given": "Luis", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Yun", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-27", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "27003", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Exposure to long-term environmental changes across >100s of generations results in adapted phenotypes, but little is known about how metabolic and transcriptional responses are optimized in these processes. Here, we show that thermotolerant yeast strains selected by adaptive laboratory evolution to grow at increased temperature, activated a constitutive heat stress response when grown at the optimal ancestral temperature, and that this is associated with a reduced growth rate. This preventive response was perfected by additional transcriptional changes activated when the cultivation temperature is increased. Remarkably, the sum of global transcriptional changes activated in the thermotolerant strains when transferred from the optimal to the high temperature, corresponded, in magnitude and direction, to the global changes observed in the ancestral strain exposed to the same transition. This demonstrates robustness of the yeast transcriptional program when exposed to heat, and that the thermotolerant strains streamlined their path to rapidly and optimally reach post-stress transcriptional and metabolic levels. Thus, long-term adaptation to heat improved yeasts ability to rapidly adapt to increased temperatures, but this also causes a trade-off in the growth rate at the optimal ancestral temperature.",

factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.", "doi": "10.1038/nature17671", "pmid": "27225129", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature17671"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4883595"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS770340"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7433004c1d2f4503bd74d13928168f0e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7433004c1d2f4503bd74d13928168f0e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8a3bf6eb1cc84d44b23e9ab88370932e", "title": "Targeting Serglycin Prevents Metastasis in Murine Mammary Carcinoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Roy", "given": "Ananya", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Femel", "given": "Julia", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Huijbers", "given": "Elisabeth J M", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Spillmann", "given": "Dorothe", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ringvall", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Olsson", "given": "Anna-Karin", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "\u00c5brink", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-25", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "5", "pages": "e0156151", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "In hematopoietic cells, serglycin proteoglycans mainly contribute to proper storage and secretion of inflammatory mediators via their negatively charged glycosaminoglycans.

In the present study we report that genetic ablation of serglycin proteoglycan completely blocks lung metastasis in the MMTV-PyMT-driven mouse breast cancer model, while serglycin-deficiency did not affect primary tumour growth or number of mammary tumours. Although E-cadherin expression was higher in the serglycin-deficient primary tumour tissue, indicating reduced invasiveness, serglycin-deficient tumour cells were still detected in the circulation. These data suggest that serglycin proteoglycans play a role in extravasation as well as colonization and growth of metastatic cells.

We derived three GAG scores that distinguished mccRCC patients with 93.1%-100% accuracy. We validated the score accuracies in an independent cohort (up to 18 mccRCC versus nine healthy) and verified that the scores normalized in eight patients with no evidence of disease.

Across a surface water transect spanning the sparsely studied tropical Indian Ocean, we examined Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus occurrence, taxonomy and habitat preference in an evolutionary context. Shotgun sequencing of size fractionated microbial communities from 0.1 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicated that cyanobacteria account for up to 15% of annotated reads, with the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus comprising 90% of the cyanobacterial reads, even in the largest size fraction (3.0-20 mm). Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial light-harvesting genes (chl-binding pcb/isiA, allophycocyanin (apcAB), phycocyanin (cpcAB) and phycoerythin (cpeAB)) mostly identified picocyanobacteria clades comprised of overlapping sequences obtained from Indian Ocean, Atlantic and/or Pacific Oceans samples. Habitat reconstructions coupled with phylogenetic analysis of the Indian Ocean samples suggested that large Synechococcus-like ancestors in coastal waters expanded their ecological niche towards open oligotrophic waters in the Indian Ocean through lineage diversification and associated streamlining of genomes (e.g. loss of phycobilisomes and acquisition of Chl b); resulting in contemporary small celled Prochlorococcus.

The aim was further to test whether dispersal effects on bacterial abundance and functional parameters (average community growth rates, respiration rates, substrate utilisation ability) differ in dependence of the initial diversity of the communities. First of all, we found that both initial diversity and dispersal rates had an effect on the recruitment of taxa from a regional source, which was higher in communities with low initial diversity and at higher rates of dispersal. Higher initial diversity and dispersal also promoted higher levels of richness and evenness in local communities and affected, both, separately or interactively, the functional performance of communities.

In a cross-validation test on a benchmark set of 42 proteins, BOCTOPUS2 predicts the correct topology in 69% of the proteins, an improvement of more than 10% over the best earlier method (BOCTOPUS) and in addition, it produces significantly fewer erroneous predictions on non-transmembrane \u03b2-barrel proteins.\n\nBOCTOPUS2 webserver along with full dataset and source code is available at http://boctopus.bioinfo.se/\n\n: arne@bioinfo.se\n\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btw025", "pmid": "26794316", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "btw025"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e418bc5f3b0e4895be1006cb94cbf3c8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e418bc5f3b0e4895be1006cb94cbf3c8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ec806726683e4a7494d288ba74b669a2", "title": "Minimal selective concentrations of tetracycline in complex aquatic bacterial biofilms.", "authors": [{"family": "Lundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Sara V", "initials": "SV"}, {"family": "\u00d6stman", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bengtsson-Palme", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rutgersson", "given": "Carolin", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Thoudal", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sircar", "given": "Triranta", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Blanck", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "K Martin", "initials": "KM"}, {"family": "Tysklind", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Flach", "given": "Carl-Fredrik", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "D G Joakim", "initials": "DG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-15", "journal": {"volume": "553", "issn": "1879-1026", "issue": null, "pages": "587-595", "title": "Sci.

Tetracyclines comprise an antibiotic class of great importance to both human and animal health. Accordingly, residues of tetracycline are commonly detected in aquatic environments. To assess if tetracycline pollution in aquatic environments promotes development of resistance, we determined minimal selective concentrations (MSCs) in biofilms of complex aquatic bacterial communities using both phenotypic and genotypic assays. Tetracycline significantly increased the relative abundance of resistant bacteria at 10 \u03bcg/L, while specific tet genes (tetA and tetG) increased significantly at the lowest concentration tested (1 \u03bcg/L). Taxonomic composition of the biofilm communities was altered with increasing tetracycline concentrations. Metagenomic analysis revealed a concurrent increase of several tet genes and a range of other genes providing resistance to different classes of antibiotics (e.g. cmlA, floR, sul1, and mphA), indicating potential for co-selection. Consequently, MSCs for the tet genes of \u2264 1 \u03bcg/L suggests that current exposure levels in e.g. sewage treatment plants could be sufficient to promote resistance.

High-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes offers a means to identify taxa inaccessible by traditional methods; thus, recent studies have unveiled an extensive previously unknown diversity of plankton.

Patients classified as grade 2 are at risk of both under- and over-treatment.\n\nRNA-sequencing analysis was conducted in a cohort of 275 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Multivariate prediction models were developed to classify tumours into high and low transcriptomic grade (TG) based on gene- and isoform-level expression data from RNA-sequencing.

The data are consistent with a mechanistic proposal whereby the Fe(IV) = O center abstracts the H5'' atom from the amino sugar of the substrate, with subsequent attack of the aromatic C2 carbon on the radical center. We further show that, in the same metabolic pathway, the homologous SnoN (38% sequence identity) catalyzes an epimerization step at the adjacent C4'' carbon, most likely via a radical mechanism involving the Fe(IV) = O center. SnoK and SnoN have surprisingly similar active site architectures considering the markedly different chemistries catalyzed by the enzymes.

Some cyanobacteria can be toxic and their impact on ecosystem services is relevant for a sustainable sea.

Here we unravel successional patterns and changes in cyanobacterial community structure using a 2-year monthly time- series during the productive season in a 100 km coastal-offshore transect using microscopy and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. A total of 565 cyanobacterial OTUs were found, of which 231 where filamentous/colonial and 334 picocyanobacterial. Spatial differences in community structure between coastal and offshore waters were minor. An \"epidemic population structure\" (dominance of asingle cluster) was found for Aphanizomenon/Dolichospermum within the filamentous/colonial cyanobacterial community. In summer, this clusters imultaneously occurred with opportunistic clusters/OTUs, e.g., Nodularia spumigena and Pseudanabaena. Picocyanobacteria, Synechococcus/Cyanobium, formeda consistent but highly diverse group. Overall, the potential drivers structuring summer cyanobacterial communities were temperature and salinity. However, the different responses to environmental factors among and within genera suggest high niche specificity for individual OTUs. The recruitment and occurrence of potentially toxic filamentous/colonial clusters was likely related to disturbance such as mixing events and short-term shifts in salinity, and not solely dependent on increasing temperature and nitrogen-limiting conditions. Nutrients did not explain further the changes in cyanobacterial community composition. Novel occurrence patterns were identified as a strong seasonal succession revealing a tight coupling between the emergence of opportunistic picocynobacteria and the bloom offilamentous/colonialclusters. These findings highlight that if environmental conditions can partially explain the presence of opportunistic picocyanobacteria, microbial and trophic interactions with filamentous/colonial cyanobacteria should also be considered as potential shaping factors for single-celled communities. Regional climate change scenarios in the Baltic Sea predict environmental shifts leading to higher temperature and lower salinity; conditions identified here as favorable for opportunistic filamentous/colonial cyanobacteria.

We found that the primary transcriptomic effect associated with elevated steady state auxin concentration in elongating root cells is up-regulation of cell wall remodeling factors, notably expansins, while plant hormone signaling pathways maintain remarkable homeostasis. These changes are specifically accompanied by reduced cell wall arabinogalactan complexity but not by increased proton excretion. On the contrary, we observed a tendency for decreased rather than increased proton extrusion from root elongation zones with higher cellular auxin levels. Moreover, similar to Brachypodium distachyon, root cell elongation is, in general, robustly buffered against external pH fluctuation in Arabidopsis thaliana.

In this study, we analyse three fragments of the MHC DQA gene in woolly mammoth samples radiocarbon dated to before and after a well-documented bottleneck that took place about ten thousand years ago. Our results indicate a decrease in observed heterozygosity and number of alleles, suggesting that genetic drift had an impact on the variation on MHC. Based on coalescent simulations, we found no evidence of balancing selection maintaining MHC diversity during the Holocene. However, strong trans-species polymorphism among mammoths and elephants points to historical effects of balancing selection on the woolly mammoth lineage.", "doi": "10.1038/srep25274", "pmid": "27143688", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "srep25274"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4855147"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0fe9c3d9c9944920a4f1ff97ead1062f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0fe9c3d9c9944920a4f1ff97ead1062f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "126c6aa0c64948e29dfe5d96fb13062c", "title": "Epigenetic silencing of miR-26A1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma: Impact on EZH2 expression.", "authors": [{"family": "Kopparapu", "given": "Pradeep Kumar", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Bhoi", "given": "Sujata", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mansouri", "given": "Larry", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Arabanian", "given": "Laleh S", "initials": "LS"}, {"family": "Plevova", "given": "Karla", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Pospisilova", "given": "Sarka", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wasik", "given": "Agata M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Croci", "given": "Giorgio Alberto", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Sander", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Paulli", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rosenquist", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kanduri", "given": "Meena", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-03", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1559-2308", "issue": "5", "pages": "335-343", "title": "Epigenetics"}, "abstract": "Downregulation of miR26A1 has been reported in various B-cell malignancies; however, the mechanism behind its deregulation remains largely unknown. We investigated miR26A1 methylation and expression levels in a well-characterized series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). From 450K methylation arrays, we first observed miR26A1 (cg26054057) as uniformly hypermethylated in MCL (n = 24) (all >75%), while CLL (n = 18) showed differential methylation between prognostic subgroups. Extended analysis using pyrosequencing confirmed our findings and real-time quantitative PCR verified low miR26A1 expression in both CLL (n = 70) and MCL (n = 38) compared to normal B-cells. Notably, the level of miR26A1 methylation predicted outcome in CLL, with higher levels seen in poor-prognostic, IGHV-unmutated CLL. Since EZH2 was recently reported as a target for miR26A1, we analyzed the expression levels of both miR26A1 and EZH2 in primary CLL samples and observed an inverse correlation. By overexpression of miR26A1 in CLL and MCL cell lines, reduced EZH2 protein levels were observed using both Western blot and flow cytometry. In contrast, methyl-inhibitor treatment led to upregulated miR26A1 expression with a parallel decrease of EZH2 expression. Finally, increased levels of apoptosis were observed in miR26A1-overexpressing cell lines, further underscoring the functional relevance of miR26A1. In summary, we propose that epigenetic silencing of miR26A1 is required for the maintenance of increased levels of EZH2, which in turn translate into a worse outcome, as shown in CLL, highlighting miR26A1 as a tumor suppressor miRNA.", "doi": "10.1080/15592294.2016.1164375", "pmid": "27052808", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4889270"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/126c6aa0c64948e29dfe5d96fb13062c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/126c6aa0c64948e29dfe5d96fb13062c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1bbb53c9a0e54de0a25640f9b9319b91", "title": "The genetic basis for ecological adaptation of the Atlantic herring revealed by genome sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Martinez Barrio", "given": "Alvaro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lamichhaney", "given": "Sangeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fan", "given": "Guangyi", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Rafati", "given": "Nima", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "He", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Dainat", "given": "Jacques", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ekman", "given": "Diana", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "H\u00f6ppner", "given": "Marc", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jern", "given": "Patric", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Martin", "given": "Marcel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nystedt", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Xin", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Wenbin", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Liang", "given": "Xinming", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Shi", "given": "Chengcheng", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fu", "given": "Yuanyuan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Ma", "given": "Kailong", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Zhan", "given": "Xiao", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Feng", "given": "Chungang", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Gustafson", "given": "Ulla", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Rubin", "given": "Carl-Johan", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "S\u00e4llman Alm\u00e9n", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Blass", "given": "Martina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Casini", "given": "Michele", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Folkvord", "given": "Arild", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Laikre", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ryman", "given": "Nils", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Ming-Yuen Lee", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Xun", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-03", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2050-084X", "issue": null, "title": "Elife"}, "abstract": "Ecological adaptation is of major relevance to speciation and sustainable population management, but the underlying genetic factors are typically hard to study in natural populations due to genetic differentiation caused by natural selection being confounded with genetic drift in subdivided populations.

To test the social drift hypothesis, we used three complementary genetically informed Swedish cohorts. First, we used nationwide Swedish data on approximately 760 000 full- and half-sibling pairs born between 1951 and 1974 and quantitative genetic models to study genetic and environmental influences on the overlap between schizophrenia in young adulthood and subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Schizophrenia diagnoses were ascertained using the National Patient Registry. Second, we tested the overlap between childhood psychotic experiences and neighborhood deprivation in early adulthood in the longitudinal Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD; n=2960). Third, we investigated to what extent polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia predicted residence in deprived neighborhoods during late adulthood using the TwinGene sample (n=6796). Sibling data suggested that living in deprived neighborhoods was substantially heritable; 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 60-71%) of the variance was attributed to genetic influences. Although the correlation between schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was moderate in magnitude (r=0.22; 95% CI: 0.20-0.24), it was entirely explained by genetic influences. We replicated these findings in the TCHAD sample. Moreover, the association between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was statistically significant (R(2)=0.15%, P=0.002). Our findings are primarily consistent with a genetic selection interpretation where genetic liability for schizophrenia also predicts subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods.

The SCZ sample comprised 18\u202f957 SCZ cases and 22\u202f673 controls in a genome-wide association study from the second phase of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the AFB sample comprised 12\u202f247 genotyped women measured for AFB from the following 4 community cohorts: Estonia (Estonian Genome Center Biobank, University of Tartu), the Netherlands (LifeLines Cohort Study), Sweden (Swedish Twin Registry), and the United Kingdom (TwinsUK). Schizophrenia genetic risk for each woman in the AFB community sample was estimated using genetic effects inferred from the SCZ genome-wide association study.\n\nWe tested if SCZ genetic risk was a significant predictor of response variables based on published polynomial functions that described the relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring in Denmark. We substituted AFB for maternal age in these functions, one of which was corrected for the age of the father, and found that the fit was superior for the model without adjustment for the father's age.\n\nWe observed a U-shaped relationship between SCZ risk and AFB in the community cohorts, consistent with the previously reported relationship between SCZ risk in offspring and maternal age when not adjusted for the age of the father. We confirmed that SCZ risk profile scores significantly predicted the response variables (coefficient of determination R2\u2009=\u20091.1E-03, P\u2009=\u20094.1E-04), reflecting the published relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring by McGrath et al in 2014.\n\nThis study provides evidence for a significant overlap between genetic factors associated with risk of SCZ and genetic factors associated with AFB. It has been reported that SCZ risk associated with increased maternal age is explained by the age of the father and that de novo mutations that occur more frequently in the germline of older men are the underlying causal mechanism.

We show that Fun30 chromatin remodelers cooperate to maintain a high level of nucleosome occupancy at retrotransposon-flanking long terminal repeat (LTR) elements. This enforces the use of a downstream TSS and the production of a truncated RNA incapable of reverse transcription and retrotransposition. However, in stressed cells, nucleosome occupancy at LTR elements is reduced, and the TSS shifts to allow for productive transcription.

TrxR1 can catalyze efficient reduction of juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; walnut toxin) in a reaction which, in contrast to reduction of most other substrates of TrxR1, is not dependent upon an intact selenocysteine (Sec, U) residue of the enzyme. Using a number of TrxR1 mutant variants, we here found that a sole Cys residue at the C-terminal tail of TrxR1 is required for high-efficiency juglone-coupled NADPH oxidase activity of Sec-deficient enzyme, occurring with mixed one- and two-electron reactions producing superoxide. The activity also utilizes the FAD and the N-terminal redox active disulfide/dithiol motif of TrxR1. If a sole Cys residue at the C-terminal tail of TrxR1, in the absence of Sec, was moved further towards the C-terminal end of the protein compared to its natural position at residue 497, juglone reduction was, surprisingly, further increased. Ala substitutions of Trp407, Asn418 and Asn419 in a previously described \"guiding bar\", thought to mediate interactions of the C-terminal tail of TrxR1 with the FAD/dithiol site at the N-terminal domain of the other subunit in the dimeric enzyme, lowered turnover with juglone about 4.5-fold. Four residues of Sec-deficient TrxR1 were found to be easily arylated by juglone, including the Cys residue at position 497. Based upon our observations we suggest a model for involvement of the juglone-arylated C-terminal motif of TrxR1 to explain its high activity with juglone. This study thus provides novel insights into the catalytic mechanisms of TrxR1. One-electron juglone reduction by TrxR1 producing superoxide should furthermore contribute to the well-known prooxidant cytotoxicity of juglone.", "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.02.013", "pmid": "26898501", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0891-5849(16)00064-2"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/384831bd038048c29a66fa15d59e7325.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/384831bd038048c29a66fa15d59e7325"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4206ad9430174b8393fd3b5a8cd718b6", "title": "High-Resolution Mapping of Crossover and Non-crossover Recombination Events by Whole-Genome Re-sequencing of an Avian Pedigree.", "authors": [{"family": "Smeds", "given": "Linn\u00e9a", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mugal", "given": "Carina F", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Qvarnstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ellegren", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "5", "pages": "e1006044", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Recombination is an engine of genetic diversity and therefore constitutes a key process in evolutionary biology and genetics. While the outcome of crossover recombination can readily be detected as shuffled alleles by following the inheritance of markers in pedigreed families, the more precise location of both crossover and non-crossover recombination events has been difficult to pinpoint. As a consequence, we lack a detailed portrait of the recombination landscape for most organisms and knowledge on how this landscape impacts on sequence evolution at a local scale. To localize recombination events with high resolution in an avian system, we performed whole-genome re-sequencing at high coverage of a complete three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree. We identified 325 crossovers at a median resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% of the events localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates were in excellent agreement with data from linkage mapping, were 52% higher in male (3.56 cM/Mb) than in female meiosis (2.28 cM/Mb), and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions, with the highest density in promoters and CpG islands. We further identified 267 non-crossovers, whose location was significantly associated with crossover locations. We detected a significant transmission bias (0.18) in favour of 'strong' (G, C) over 'weak' (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system.

At the western range margin of D. torquatus, these changes were characterized by a series of local extinctions and recolonizations. However, it is unclear whether this pattern represents a local phenomenon, possibly driven by ecological edge effects, or a global phenomenon that took place across large geographical scales. To address this, we explored the palaeogenetic history of the collared lemming using a next-generation sequencing approach for pooled mitochondrial DNA amplicons. Sequences were obtained from over 300 fossil remains sampled across Eurasia and two sites in North America. We identified five mitochondrial lineages of D. torquatus that succeeded each other through time across Europe and western Russia, indicating a history of repeated population extinctions and recolonizations, most likely from eastern Russia, during the last 50 000 years. The observation of repeated extinctions across such a vast geographical range indicates large-scale changes in the steppe-tundra environment in western Eurasia during the last glaciation. All Holocene samples, from across the species' entire range, belonged to only one of the five mitochondrial lineages. Thus, extant D. torquatus populations only harbour a small fraction of the total genetic diversity that existed across different stages of the Late Pleistocene. In North American samples, haplotypes belonging to both D. groenlandicus and D. richardsoni were recovered from a Late Pleistocene site in south-western Canada. This suggests that D. groenlandicus had a more southern and D. richardsoni a more northern glacial distribution than previously thought.

To identify glioma-associated genetic susceptibility factors, an across-breed genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on 39 dog glioma cases and 141 controls from 25 dog breeds, identifying a genome-wide significant locus on canine chromosome (CFA) 26 (p = 2.8 x 10-8).

A significant multivariate OPLS model was obtained between the fVAS scores and the measured metabolic levels. Increasing fatigue scores were associated with a metabolic pattern characterized by down-regulation of metabolites from the urea cycle, fatty acids, tocopherols, aromatic amino acids, and hypoxanthine.

Ordination analysis separated samples by organ rather than by species. Organs differed in their degrees of expression variance within species and expression divergence between species. Variance was negatively correlated with expression breadth and protein interactivity, suggesting that pleiotropic constraints reduce gene expression variance within species. Variance was correlated with between-species divergence, consistent with a pattern expected from stabilizing selection and neutral evolution.

No SNPs were genomewide statistically significantly associated with patch size.

Reducing the recombination by two-thirds relative to collared flycatchers modestly increased power. Tripling sample size increased power to >0.8 for resequencing of extreme phenotypes (N\u00a0=\u00a0243), but power remained <0.2 for the 50K SNP chip analysis (N\u00a0=\u00a01245). At least 1 million SNPs were necessary to achieve power >0.8 when analysing 415 randomly sampled phenotypes. However, power of the 50K SNP chip to detect large-effect loci was nearly 0.8 in simulations with a small effective population size of 1500.

For many such syndromes, the molecular pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. Parallel developmental disorders in other species could provide complementary models for human rare diseases by uncovering new candidate genes, improving the understanding of the molecular mechanisms and opening possibilities for therapeutic trials. We performed various experiments, e.g. combined genome-wide association and next generation sequencing, to investigate the clinico-pathological features and genetic causes of three developmental syndromes in dogs, including craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO), a previously undescribed skeletal syndrome, and dental hypomineralization, for which we identified pathogenic variants in the canine SLC37A2 (truncating splicing enhancer variant), SCARF2 (truncating 2-bp deletion) and FAM20C (missense variant) genes, respectively. CMO is a clinical equivalent to an infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease), for which SLC37A2 is a new candidate gene. SLC37A2 is a poorly characterized member of a glucose-phosphate transporter family without previous disease associations.

Thirty participants homozygous for the rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism were shown images of low- or high-calorie food while brain activity was measured via fMRI.

We demonstrate that in ribosome-profiling studies, detection of MTOR-dependent changes in non-TOP mRNA translation was obscured by low sensitivity and methodology biases. Transcription start site profiling using nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that not only do many MTOR-sensitive mRNAs lack the 5' TOP motif but that 5' UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of MTOR-sensitive mRNAs: (1) mRNAs with short 5' UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions, which require EIF4E but are less EIF4A1-sensitive; and (2) long 5' UTR mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, which are both EIF4E- and EIF4A1-sensitive. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5' UTRs via EIF4A1 suppression leads to sustained expression of proteins involved in respiration but concomitant loss of those protecting mitochondrial structural integrity, resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous suppression of translation of both long and short 5' UTR mRNAs by MTOR inhibitors results in metabolic dormancy and a predominantly cytostatic effect. Thus, 5' UTR features define different modes of MTOR-sensitive translation of functionally distinct subsets of mRNAs, which may explain the diverse impact of MTOR and EIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.", "doi": "10.1101/gr.197566.115", "pmid": "26984228", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "gr.197566.115"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4864462"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f081819507c347dcba39244e2fbb4517.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f081819507c347dcba39244e2fbb4517"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f81efa0cc205450e8898878b6d1c0755", "title": "Functionalized silk assembled from a recombinant spider silk fusion protein (Z-4RepCT) produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.", "authors": [{"family": "Jansson", "given": "Ronnie", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Lau", "given": "Cheuk H", "initials": "CH"}, {"family": "Ishida", "given": "Takuya", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Ramstr\u00f6m", "given": "Margareta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandgren", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hedhammar", "given": "My", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1860-7314", "issue": "5", "pages": "687-699", "title": "Biotechnol J"}, "abstract": "Functional biological materials are a growing research area with potential applicability in medicine and biotechnology.

The accessions were sampled throughout northern Europe and were established at two field sites in Pustn\u00e4s, Sweden, and at Woburn, UK, offering the opportunity to assess the impact of genotype-by-environment interactions (G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E) on trait-marker associations.

The accessions were genotyped using 1536 SNP markers developed from phenology candidate genes and from genes previously observed to be differentially expressed in contrasting environments. Association mapping between 1233 of these SNPs and the measured traits was performed taking into account population structure and threshold selection bias. At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, 29 SNPs were associated with bud burst, leaf senescence, number of shoots or shoot diameter. The percentage of accession variation (Radj2) explained by these associations ranged from 0.3% to 4.4%, suggesting that the studied traits are controlled by many loci of limited individual impact.

Here, we investigated to which extent the lack of the major isoform, mMDH1 accounting for about 60% of the activity, affected leaf metabolism. In air, rosettes of mmdh1 plants were only slightly smaller than wild type plants although the fresh weight was decreased by about 50%. In low CO2 the difference was much bigger, with mutant plants accumulating only 14% of fresh weight as compared to wild type. To investigate the metabolic background to the differences in growth, we developed a (13)CO2 labelling method, using a custom-built chamber that enabled simultaneous treatment of sets of plants under controlled conditions. The metabolic profiles were analysed by gas- and liquid- chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolic adjustments between wild type and mmdh1 The genotypes responded similarly to high CO2 treatment both with respect to metabolite pools and (13)C incorporation during a 2-h treatment. However, under low CO2 several metabolites differed between the two genotypes and, interestingly most of these were closely associated with photorespiration.

In response to phytoplankton exudates and environmental factors, heterotrophic microbial communities are highly dynamic and change their abundance and composition both on spatial and temporal scales. Yet, most of our understanding about these processes comes from laboratory model organism studies, mesocosm experiments or single temporal transects. Spatial-temporal studies examining interactions of phytoplankton blooms and bacterioplankton community composition and function, though being highly informative, are scarce. In this study, pelagic microbial community dynamics (bacteria and phytoplankton) and environmental variables were monitored during a spring bloom across the Baltic Proper (two cruises between North Germany to Gulf of Finland). To test to what extent bacterioplankton community composition relates to the spring bloom, we used next generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, phytoplankton diversity analysis based on microscopy counts and population genotyping of the dominating diatom Skeletonema marinoi. Several phytoplankton bloom related and environmental variables were identified to influence bacterial community composition. Members of Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community composition but the bacterial groups showed no apparent correlation with direct bloom related variables. The less abundant bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia, on the other hand, were strongly associated with phytoplankton biomass, diatom:dinoflagellate ratio, and colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM). Many bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed high niche specificities. For example, particular Bacteroidetes OTUs were associated with two distinct genetic clusters of S. marinoi.

The EPHB2 protein expression was also analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin embedded material (cohort 2). EPHB2 was detected in the membrane and cytoplasmic cell compartments and there was an inverse correlation between membranous and cytoplasmic EPHB2.

In vivo, this problem is most likely avoided by targeting of the TM-proteins, so that non-TM proteins never see the translocon. Proteins are targeted to the translocon by an N-terminal signal peptide. The targeting is also aided by the fact that the N-terminal helix is more hydrophobic than other TM-helices.

Binding of ligands within its natural hormone binding site can stabilize the tetrameric structure and impair amyloid formation. We have recently shown that the flavonoid luteolin stabilizes TTR in human plasma with a very high selectivity. Luteolin, however, is inactivated in vivo via glucuronidation for which the preferred site is the hydroxy group at position 7 on its aromatic A-ring. We have evaluated the properties of two luteolin variants in which the 7-hydroxy group has been exchanged for a chlorine (7-Cl-Lut) or a methoxy group (7-MeO-Lut). Using an in vitro model, based on human liver microsomes, we verified that these modifications increase the persistence of the drug. Crystal structure determinations show that 7-Cl-Lut binds similarly to luteolin. The larger MeO substituent cannot be accommodated within the same space as the chlorine or hydroxy group and as a result 7-MeO-Lut binds in the opposite direction with the methoxy group in position 7 facing the solvent. Both 7-Cl-Lut and 7-MeO-Lut qualify as high-affinity binders, but in contrast to luteolin, they display a highly non-specific binding to other plasma components. The binding of the two conformations and the key-interactions to TTR are discussed in detail. Taken together, these results show a proof-of-concept that the persistence of luteolin towards enzymatic modification can be increased. We reveal two alternative high-affinity binding modes of luteolin to TTR and that modification in position 7 is restricted only to small substituents if the original orientation of luteolin should be preserved.

Cytotoxicity was also studied by time-lapse live-cell imaging in microwells quantifying the killing potential of individual NK cells. Although most resting NK cells (\u224875%) were non-cytotoxic against the leukemia cell line K562, some NK cells were able to kill several (\u22653) target cells within the 12-h long experiment. In addition, the screening approach was adapted to increase the chance to find and evaluate serial killing NK cells. Even if the cytotoxic potential varied between donors, it was evident that a small fraction of highly cytotoxic NK cells were responsible for a substantial portion of the killing.

The developmental period investigated spanned from beginning of gonadal differentiation, Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) stage 51, to 4weeks post-metamorphosis. The M\u00fcllerian ducts were first observed at NF 64 in both sexes. Male-enhanced amh mRNA levels from NF 53/54 to 6days post-metamorphosis and female-enhanced cyp19a1 levels from NF 53 to 4weeks post-metamorphosis were noted. The sexually dimorphic mRNA level profile was more distinct for amh than for cyp19a1. The pgrs mRNA levels increased over the studied period and showed no sex differences.

We used a discovery set of 3740 patients from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, which enrolled 18 624 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A further set of 5492 patients, from the same trial, was used for replication.

The association in SLC39A8 is driven by a deleterious variant (rs13107325, pooled P = 5.99 \u00d7 10(-10)), whereas the most significant SNP in POC1B/GALNT4 (rs11105306, pooled P = 1.02 \u00d7 10(-16)) is intronic.

In this study, the two recently synthesized 13-membered macrocyclic competitive IRAP inhibitors HA08 and HA09, which were designed to mimic the N terminus of oxytocin and vasopressin, were assessed and compared based on their ability to bind to the IRAP active site, and alter dendritic spine density in rat hippocampal primary cultures.

The binding free energies calculated with the linear interaction energy method, which are in excellent agreement with experimental data and simulations, have been used to explain the differences in activities of the IRAP inhibitors, both of which are structurally very similar, but differ only with regard to one stereogenic center. In addition, we show that HA08, which is 100-fold more potent than the epimer HA09, can enhance dendritic spine number and alter morphology, a process associated with memory facilitation.

The results identified a considerable number of AS genes in skeletal muscle, thymus, bone, and white adipose tissue between the different age groups (ranging from 27 to 246 AS genes corresponding to 0.3-3.2% of the total number of genes analyzed). For skin, skeletal muscle, and bone, we included a later age group (28 months old) that showed that the number of alternatively spliced genes increased with age in all three tissues (P < 0.01). Analysis of alternatively spliced genes across all tissues by gene ontology and pathway analysis identified 158 genes involved in RNA processing. Additional analysis of AS in a mouse model for the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was performed. The results show that expression of the mutant protein, progerin, is associated with an impaired developmental splicing. As progerin accumulates, the number of genes with AS increases compared to in wild-type skin.

The packed program included keynote and plenary talks, short oral presentations and poster sessions, workshops, and strategic discussions. The meeting was a great success and revealed dramatically how important the zebrafish in particular has become as a model system for topics, such as developmental biology, functional genomics, biomedicine, toxicology, and drug development. A new emphasis was given to its potential as a model for aquaculture, a topic of great economic interest to the host country Norway and for the future global food supply in general. Zebrafish husbandry as well as its use in teaching were also covered in separate workshops. As has become a tradition in these meetings, there was a well-attended Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and ZFIN workshop focused on Zebrafish Genome Resources on the first day.

Thirteen highly trained athletes (9 men and 4 women; maximal oxygen uptake: 66 \u00b1 1 mL\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)) performed 3 identical submaximal incremental tests on a cycle ergometer using a cross-over design. A control test (CON) was performed 3 h after a standardized breakfast, a fasting test (FAST) 12 h after a standardized evening meal, and a postexercise test (EXER) after standardized breakfast, endurance exercise, and 2 h fasting recovery. The test consisted of 3 min each at 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% of maximal oxygen uptake and fat oxidation rates were measured through indirect calorimetry. During CON, maximal fat oxidation rate was 0.51 \u00b1 0.04 g\u00b7min(-1) compared with 0.69 \u00b1 0.04 g\u00b7min(-1) in FAST (P < 0.01), and 0.89 \u00b1 0.05 g\u00b7min(-1) in EXER (P < 0.01). Across all intensities, EXER was significantly higher than FAST and FAST was higher than CON (P < 0.01). Blood insulin levels were lower and free fatty acid and cortisol levels were higher at the start of EXER compared with CON and FAST (P < 0.05). Plasma nuclear magnetic resonance-metabolomics showed similar changes in both EXER and FAST, including increased levels of fatty acids and succinate. In conclusion, prior exercise significantly increases whole-body fat oxidation during submaximal exercise compared with overnight fasting.

As gene expression assays are not yet universally available, routine immunohistochemical stains act as surrogate markers for these subtypes. Thus, congruence of surrogate markers and gene expression tests is of utmost importance. In this study, 3 cohorts of primary breast cancer specimens (total n=436) with up to 28 years of survival data were scored for Ki67, ER, PR, and HER2 status manually and by digital image analysis (DIA). The results were then compared for sensitivity and specificity for the Luminal B subtype, concordance to PAM50 assays in subtype classification and prognostic power. The DIA system used was the Visiopharm Integrator System. DIA outperformed manual scoring in terms of sensitivity and specificity for the Luminal B subtype, widely considered the most challenging distinction in surrogate subclassification, and produced slightly better concordance and Cohen's \u03ba agreement with PAM50 gene expression assays. Manual biomarker scores and DIA essentially matched each other for Cox regression hazard ratios for all-cause mortality. When the Nottingham combined histologic grade (Elston-Ellis) was used as a prognostic surrogate, stronger Spearman's rank-order correlations were produced by DIA. Prognostic value of Ki67 scores in terms of likelihood ratio \u03c7(2) (LR \u03c7(2)) was higher for DIA that also added significantly more prognostic information to the manual scores (LR-\u0394\u03c7(2)). In conclusion, the system for DIA evaluated here was in most aspects a superior alternative to manual biomarker scoring.

Furthermore, Trolox exhibited a unique effect on PMNCs that has not previously been reported: It delayed the production of ROS in a manner distinct from antioxidant activity.

Here, we provide an overview of how such technologies have been applied to study neurological disease and we also discuss some important considerations concerning discovery of disease-associated profiles.", "doi": "10.1002/prca.201500065", "pmid": "26286680", "labels": {"Autoimmunity Profiling": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/90b020cf6aaf415fbd5f81ac9c8c3fc8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/90b020cf6aaf415fbd5f81ac9c8c3fc8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "934437159dbf4d53b8a0a4ae01008efb", "title": "Novel mode of inhibition by D-tagatose 6-phosphate through a Heyns rearrangement in the active site of transaldolase B variants.", "authors": [{"family": "Stellmacher", "given": "Lena", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Sandalova", "given": "Tatyana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Gunter", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sprenger", "given": "Georg A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Samland", "given": "Anne K", "initials": "AK"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "72", "issn": "2059-7983", "issue": "Pt 4", "pages": "467-476", "title": "Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol"}, "abstract": "Transaldolase B (TalB) and D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase A (FSAA) from Escherichia coli are C-C bond-forming enzymes.

The crystal structure of the variant TalB(F178Y) with bound sugar phosphate was solved to a resolution of 1.46 \u00c5 and revealed a novel mode of covalent inhibition. The sugar is bound covalently via its C2 atom to the \u2107-NH2 group of the active-site residue Lys132. It is neither bound in the open-chain form nor as the closed-ring form of D-T6P, but has been converted to \u03b2-D-galactofuranose 6-phosphate (D-G6P), a five-membered ring structure. The furanose ring of the covalent adduct is formed via a Heyns rearrangement and subsequent hemiacetal formation. This reaction is facilitated by Tyr178, which is proposed to act as acid-base catalyst. The crystal structure of the inhibitor complex is compared with the structure of the Schiff-base intermediate of TalB(E96Q) formed with the substrate D-fructose 6-phosphate determined to a resolution of 2.20\u2005\u00c5.

We studied gene transcription, applying a modern and efficient RNA-seq protocol. In parallel, endometrial stromal cells were cultured and global expression profiles were compared with uncultured cells.\n\nFor method validation, we used two endometrial biopsies, one from mid-secretory phase (Day 21, LH+8) and another from late-secretory phase (Day 25). The samples underwent single-cell FACS sorting, single-cell RNA-seq library preparation and Illumina sequencing.\n\nHere we present a complete pipeline for single-cell gene-expression studies, from clinical sampling to statistical data analysis. Tissue manipulation, starting from disaggregation and cell-type-specific labelling and ending with single-cell automated sorting, is managed within 90 min at low temperature to minimize changes in the gene expression profile. The single living stromal and epithelial cells were sorted using CD13- and CD9-specific antibodies, respectively.

In addition, we performed a gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes and found that these genes are mainly related to cell cycle, translational processes and metabolism.\n\nAlthough CD9-positive single epithelial cells sorting was successfully established in our laboratory, the amount of transcriptome data per individual epithelial cell was low, complicating further analysis. This step most likely failed due to the high dose of RNases that are released by the cells' natural processes, or due to rapid turnaround time or the apoptotic conditions in freezing- or single-cell solutions. Since only the cells from the late-secretory phase were subject to more focused analysis, further studies including larger sample size from the different time-points of the natural menstrual cycle are needed.

This large selective effect on cellobiose hydrolysis is manifested as a change in substrate selectivity from cellobiose to lactose. The least affected variant is F417Y, which retains the capacity to hydrolyze both cellobiose and lactose with the same relative substrate selectivity as the wild type, but with ~10-fold lower turnover numbers.

Studies on \u03b3-secretase location are therefore crucial both from a biological and a therapeutic perspective. Despite several years of efforts in many laboratories, it is not clear where in the neuron \u03b3-secretase exerts it's activities. Technical challenges include the fact that the active enzyme contains four protein components and that most subcellular compartments cannot be spatially resolved by traditional light microscopy. Here, we have used a powerful combination of the two nanoscopy techniques STORM and STED microscopy to visualize the location of \u03b3-secretase in neurons using an active-site specific probe, with a focus on the synapse. We show that \u03b3-secretase is present in both the pre-and postsynaptic compartments.

The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae).

CC was carboxylated by electrochemical TEMPO-mediated oxidation. By varying the amount of charge passed through the electrolysis setup, CC materials with different degrees of oxidation were obtained. The effect of carboxyl group density on the material's physicochemical properties was investigated together with the response of human dermal fibroblasts (hDF) and human osteoblastic cells (Saos-2) to the carboxylated CC films. The introduction of carboxyl groups resulted in CC films with decreased specific surface area and smaller total pore volume compared with the unmodified CC (u-CC). While u-CC films presented a porous network of randomly oriented fibers, a compact and aligned fiber pattern was depicted for the carboxylated-CC films. The decrease in surface area and total pore volume, and the orientation and aggregation of the fibers tended to augment parallel to the increase in the carboxyl group density. hDF and Saos-2 cells presented poor cell adhesion and spreading on u-CC, which gradually increased for the carboxylated CC as the degree of oxidation increased. It was found that a threshold value in carboxyl group density needs be reached to obtain a carboxylated-CC film with cytocompatibility comparable to commercial tissue culture material. Hence, this study demonstrates that a normally bioinert nanomaterial can be rendered bioactive by carefully tuning the density of charged groups on the material surface, a finding that not only may contribute to the fundamental understanding of biointerface phenomena, but also to the development of bioinert/bioactive materials.", "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.6b00053", "pmid": "26886265", "labels": {"BioMaterial Interactions (BioMat)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3439ae0f46a049be9c0313701fc36918.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3439ae0f46a049be9c0313701fc36918"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dbdfdcd357054fafbba384012ae676cc", "title": "Luminescent Nanocellulose Platform: From Controlled Graft Block Copolymerization to Biomarker Sensing.", "authors": [{"family": "Navarro", "given": "Julien R G", "initials": "JR"}, {"family": "Wennmalm", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Godfrey", "given": "Jamie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Breitholtz", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Edlund", "given": "Ulrica", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-03-14", "journal": {"volume": "17", "issn": "1526-4602", "issue": "3", "pages": "1101-1109", "title": "Biomacromolecules"}, "abstract": "A strategy is devised for the conversion of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) into fluorescently labeled probes involving the synthesis of CNF-based macroinitiators that initiate radical polymerization of methyl acrylate and acrylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester producing a graft block copolymer modified CNF.

Two synthetic benzene and biphenyl polyphosphates (BzP/BiPhPs), simplified surrogates of inositol phosphates and phospholipid headgroups, were identified by thermodynamic studies as potent INPP5B ligands. The X-ray structure of the complex between INPP5B and biphenyl 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexakisphosphate [BiPh(3,3',4,4',5,5')P6, IC50 5.5 \u03bcM] was determined at 2.89 \u00c5 resolution. One inhibitor pole locates in the phospholipid headgroup binding site and the second solvent-exposed ring binds to the His-Tag of another INPP5B molecule, while a molecule of inorganic phosphate is also present in the active site. Benzene 1,2,3-trisphosphate [Bz(1,2,3)P3] [one ring of BiPh(3,3',4,4',5,5')P6] inhibits INPP5B ca. 6-fold less potently. Co-crystallization with benzene 1,2,4,5-tetrakisphosphate [Bz(1,2,4,5)P4, IC50 = 6.3 \u03bcM] yielded a structure refined at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. Conserved residues among the 5-phosphatase family mediate interactions with Bz(1,2,4,5)P4 and BiPh(3,3',4,4',5,5')P6 similar to those with the polar groups present in positions 1, 4, 5, and 6 on the inositol ring of the substrate. 5-Phosphatase specificity most likely resides in the variable zone located close to the 2- and 3-positions of the inositol ring, offering insights to inhibitor design. We propose that the inorganic phosphate present in the INPP5B-BiPh(3,3',4,4',5,5')P6 complex mimics the postcleavage substrate 5-phosphate released by INPP5B in the catalytic site, allowing elucidation of two new key features in the catalytic mechanism proposed for the family of phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases: first, the involvement of the conserved Arg-451 in the interaction with the 5-phosphate and second, identification of the water molecule that initiates 5-phosphate hydrolysis.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease relies on cognitive tests and analysis of amyloid beta, protein tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid. Although these markers provide relatively high sensitivity and specificity for early disease detection, they are not suitable for monitor of disease progression. In the present study, we used label-free shotgun mass spectrometry to analyse the cerebrospinal fluid proteome of Alzheimer's disease patients and non-demented controls to identify potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. We processed the data using five programs (DecyderMS, Maxquant, OpenMS, PEAKS, and Sieve) and compared their results by means of reproducibility and peptide identification, including three different normalization methods. After depletion of high abundant proteins we found that Alzheimer's disease patients had lower fraction of low-abundance proteins in cerebrospinal fluid compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). Consequently, global normalization was found to be less accurate compared to using spiked-in chicken ovalbumin for normalization. In addition, we determined that Sieve and OpenMS resulted in the highest reproducibility and PEAKS was the programs with the highest identification performance. Finally, we successfully verified significantly lower levels (p<0.05) of eight proteins (A2GL, APOM, C1QB, C1QC, C1S, FBLN3, PTPRZ, and SEZ6) in Alzheimer's disease compared to controls using an antibody-based detection method.

The rats were intubated and mechanically ventilated. A controlled cortical impact device created a 3-mm deep lesion in the right parietal hemisphere. Post-injury, rats inhaled either normoxic (22% O2) or hypoxic (11% O2) mixtures for 30\u2009min. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28\u2009days post-injury. Serum was collected for S100B measurements using ELISA. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to determine lesion size and edema volume. Immunofluorescence was employed to analyze neuronal death, changes in cerebral macrophage- and neutrophil infiltration, microglia proliferation, apoptosis, complement activation (C5b9), IgG extravasation, HIF-1\u03b1, and VEGF.\n\nThe hypoxic group had significantly increased blood levels of lactate and decreased pO2 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). On MRI post-traumatic hypoxia resulted in larger lesion areas (p\u2009=\u20090.0173), and NeuN staining revealed greater neuronal loss (p\u2009=\u20090.0253). HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression was significantly increased in normoxic but not in hypoxic animals (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

No differences were observed between the groups in cytotoxic and vascular edema, IgG extravasation, neutrophils and macrophage aggregation, microglia proliferation, or C5b-9 expression.\n\nHypoxia following focal TBI exacerbated the lesion size and neuronal loss. Moreover, there was a tendency to higher levels of S100B in the hypoxic group early after injury, indicating a potential validity as a biomarker of injury severity. In the normoxic group, the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF was found elevated, possibly indicative of neuro-protective responses occurring in this less severely injured group.

However, the inverse Laplace transform (ILT) that is used to extract the distribution of diffusion coefficients from an NMR signal is known to be unstable and vulnerable to noise. Numerous regularisation techniques to circumvent this problem have been proposed. In our recent study, we proposed a method based on sparsity-enforcing l1-norm minimisation. This approach, which is referred to as ITAMeD, has been successful but limited to samples with a 'discrete' distribution of diffusion coefficients. In this paper, we propose a generalisation of ITAMeD using a tailored lp-norm (1 \u2264 p \u2264 2) to process, in particular, signals arising from 'polydisperse' samples. The performance of our method was tested on simulations and experimental datasets of polyethylene oxides with varying polydispersity indices.

Aligning bisulfite-treated reads, however, is a computationally difficult task: bisulfite treatment decreases the (lexical) complexity of low-methylated genomic regions, and C-to-T mismatches may reflect cytosine unmethylation rather than SNPs or sequencing errors. Further challenges arise both during and after the alignment phase: data structures used by the aligner should be fast and should fit into main memory, and the methylation-caller output should be somehow compressed, due to its significant size.\n\nAs far as data structures employed to align bisulfite-treated reads are concerned, solutions proposed in the literature can be roughly grouped into two main categories: those storing pointers at each text position (e.g. hash tables, suffix trees/arrays), and those using the information-theoretic minimum number of bits (e.g. FM indexes and compressed suffix arrays). The former are fast and memory consuming. The latter are much slower and light. In this paper, we try to close this gap proposing a data structure for aligning bisulfite-treated reads which is at the same time fast, light, and very accurate.

Importantly, the noncanonical methionine at peptide position 5 acts as a main anchor, altering only the conformation of the H-2D(b) residues Y156 and H155 and thereby forming a unique MHC/peptide conformer that is essential for recognition by TEIPP-specific T cells. Substitution of peptide residues p2C and p5M to the conservative \u03b1-aminobutyric acid and norleucine, respectively, significantly reduced complex stability, without altering peptide conformation or T cell recognition.

Transcriptome changes during the entire differentiation from trophozoites to cysts were thereafter studied using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A high level of periodicity was observed for up- and down-regulated genes, both at the level of the entire transcriptome and putative regulators. This suggests the trajectory of differentiation to be coordinated through developmentally linked gene regulatory activities. Our study identifies a core of 13 genes that are consistently up-regulated during initial encystation. Of these, two constitute previously uncharacterized proteins that we were able to localize to a new type of encystation-specific vesicles. Interestingly, the largest transcriptional changes were seen in the late phase of encystation with the majority of the highly up-regulated genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Several of these were epitope-tagged and localized to further characterize these previously unknown genetic components of encystation and possibly excystation.

To address this we used high-resolution isoelectric focusing coupled liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, an unbiased high throughput proteomics approach to comprehensively characterize the proteinaceous contents of MSCs and MSC derived exosomes. We probed the proteome of MSCs and MSC derived exosomes from cells cultured under expansion conditions and under ischemic tissue simulated conditions to elucidate key angiogenic paracrine effectors present and potentially differentially expressed in these conditions. In total, 6,342 proteins were identified in MSCs and 1,927 proteins in MSC derived exosomes, representing to our knowledge the first time these proteomes have been probed comprehensively. Multilayered analyses identified several putative paracrine effectors of angiogenesis present in MSC exosomes and increased in expression in MSCs exposed to ischemic tissue-simulated conditions; these include platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and most notably nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) signaling pathway proteins. NFkB signaling was identified as a key mediator of MSC exosome induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells by functional in vitro validation using a specific inhibitor.

All species showed evidence of population growth up until 100-200\u00a0thousand years ago (kya), followed by decline and then start of a new phase of population expansion. However, timing and amplitude of changes in Ne differed among species, and for pied flycatcher, the temporal dynamics of Ne differed between Spanish birds and central/northern European populations. This cautions against extrapolation of demographic inference between lineages and calls for adequate sampling to provide representative pictures of the coalescence process in different species or populations. We also empirically evaluate criteria for proper inference of demographic histories using PSMC and arrive at recommendations of using sequencing data with a mean genome coverage of \u226518X, a per-site filter of \u226510 reads and no more than 25% of missing data.", "doi": "10.1111/mec.13540", "pmid": "26797914", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4793928"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4b6832697b474fa0a60fb516e3da29cb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4b6832697b474fa0a60fb516e3da29cb"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "50a58f16cbd54fba9e58171f2b542b6d", "title": "Genetic influences on schizophrenia and subcortical brain volumes: large-scale proof of concept.", "authors": [{"family": "Franke", "given": "Barbara", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Stein", "given": "Jason L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Ripke", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Anttila", "given": "Verneri", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Hibar", "given": "Derrek P", "initials": "DP"}, {"family": "van Hulzen", "given": "Kimm J E", "initials": "KJ"}, {"family": "Arias-Vasquez", "given": "Alejandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Smoller", "given": "Jordan W", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Nichols", "given": "Thomas E", "initials": "TE"}, {"family": "Neale", "given": "Michael C", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "McIntosh", "given": "Andrew M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Phil", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "McMahon", "given": "Francis J", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Meyer-Lindenberg", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mattheisen", "given": "Manuel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andreassen", "given": "Ole A", "initials": "OA"}, {"family": "Gruber", "given": "Oliver", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Sachdev", "given": "Perminder S", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "Roiz-Santia\u00f1ez", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Saykin", "given": "Andrew J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Ehrlich", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mather", "given": "Karen A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Turner", "given": "Jessica A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Schwarz", "given": "Emanuel", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Thalamuthu", "given": "Anbupalam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Yao", "given": "Yin", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Ho", "given": "Yvonne Y W", "initials": "YY"}, {"family": "Martin", "given": "Nicholas G", "initials": "NG"}, {"family": "Wright", "given": "Margaret J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Psychosis Endophenotypes International Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Enigma Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "O'Donovan", "given": "Michael C", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "Thompson", "given": "Paul M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "Neale", "given": "Benjamin M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Medland", "given": "Sarah E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Sullivan", "given": "Patrick F", "initials": "PF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "19", "issn": "1546-1726", "issue": "3", "pages": "420-431", "title": "Nat.

Different analysis techniques have been used for detection of segmental abnormalities, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-microarrays and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, as next-generation sequencing becomes available for clinical use, this technique could also be used for assessment of copy number alterations simultaneously with mutational analysis. In this study we compare genomic profiles generated through exome sequencing data with profiles generated from high resolution Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays on 30 neuroblastoma tumors of different stages. Normalized coverage reads for tumors were calculated using Control-FREEC software and visualized through a web based Shiny application, prior to comparison with corresponding SNP-microarray data. The two methods show high-level agreement for breakpoints and copy number of larger segmental aberrations and numerical aneuploidies. However, several smaller gene containing deletions that could not readily be detected through the SNP-microarray analyses were identified through exome profiling, most likely due to difference between spatial distribution of microarray probes and targeted regions of the exome capture. These smaller aberrations included focal ATRX deletion in two tumors and three cases of novel deletions in chromosomal region 19q13.2 causing homozygous loss of multiple genes including the CIC (Capicua) gene. In conclusion, genomic profiles generated from normalized coverage of exome sequencing show concordance with SNP microarray generated genomic profiles. Exome sequencing is therefore a useful diagnostic tool for copy number variant (CNV) detection in neuroblastoma tumors, especially considering the combination with mutational screening.

We aimed to explore the immunohistochemical expression of the OIS markers, senescence-associated lysosomal \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-GAL), p16, and p21 in different types of 345 pituitary adenomas and compared it with the expression in the normal pituitary and in the specimens from the repeated surgeries. SA-\u03b2-GAL was overexpressed in the pituitary adenomas, compared to the normal pituitaries. Growth hormone (GH) producing adenomas showed the strongest SA-\u03b2-GAL, with densely granulated (DG)-GH adenomas more reactive than the sparsely granulated (SG). Nuclear p21 was decreased in the adenomas, except for the SG-GH adenomas that had higher p21 than the normal pituitaries and the other adenomas. p16 was significantly lower in the adenomas, without type-related differences. SA-\u03b2-GAL was slightly lower and p16 slightly higher in the recurrences. Our findings indicate alterations of the senescence program in the different types of pituitary adenomas. Activation of senescence in the pituitary adenomas presents one possible explanation for their usually benign behavior, at least in the GH adenomas that show a synchronous increase of two OIS markers. However, subdivision into GH adenoma subtypes reveals differences that reflect complex regulatory mechanisms influenced by the interplay between the granularity pattern and the hormonal factors, with possible impact on the different clinical behavior of the SG- and DG-GH adenoma subtypes. p16 seems to have a more prominent role in the pituitary tumorigenesis than in the senescence.

Extraversion item data from multiple personality inventories were harmonized across inventories and cohorts. No genome-wide significant associations were found at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level but there was one significant hit at the gene level for a long non-coding RNA site (LOC101928162). Genome-wide complex trait analysis in two large cohorts showed that the additive variance explained by common SNPs was not significantly different from zero, but polygenic risk scores, weighted using linkage information, significantly predicted extraversion scores in an independent cohort. These results show that extraversion is a highly polygenic personality trait, with an architecture possibly different from other complex human traits, including other personality traits.

The observed phenotypic differences among populations can simply be due to genetic drift, and if the genetic distance between them is not considered, the differentiation may be falsely interpreted as adaptive. Conversely, adaptive and demographic processes might have been tightly associated and correcting for the population structure may lead to false negatives. Here, we evaluated this problem in the cosmopolitan weed Capsella bursa-pastoris. We used RNA-Seq to analyse gene expression differences among 24 accessions, which belonged to a much larger group that had been previously characterized for flowering time and circadian rhythm and were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique. We found that clustering of accessions for gene expression retrieved the same three clusters that were obtained with GBS data previously, namely Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Moreover, the three groups were also differentiated for both flowering time and circadian rhythm variation. Correction for population genetic structure when analysing differential gene expression analysis removed all differences among the three groups. This may suggest that most differences are neutral and simply reflect population history. However, geographical variation in flowering time and circadian rhythm indicated that the distribution of adaptive traits might be confounded by population structure. To bypass this confounding effect, we compared gene expression differentiation between flowering ecotypes within the genetic groups. Among the differentially expressed genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C was the strongest candidate for local adaptation in regulation of flowering time.", "doi": "10.1111/mec.13537", "pmid": "26797895", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "Dryad", "key": "Q83PT"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c4d1e196683a48cd8d3d587d687dbf4d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c4d1e196683a48cd8d3d587d687dbf4d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c739409284804dc9a4e4c5d063c8fd00", "title": "Reclassification of Wolbachia persica as Francisella persica comb. nov. and emended description of the family Francisellaceae.", "authors": [{"family": "Larson", "given": "Marilynn A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Nalbantoglu", "given": "Ufuk", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Sayood", "given": "Khalid", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Zentz", "given": "Emily B", "initials": "EB"}, {"family": "Cer", "given": "Regina Zing", "initials": "RZ"}, {"family": "Iwen", "given": "Peter C", "initials": "PC"}, {"family": "Francesconi", "given": "Stephen C", "initials": "SC"}, {"family": "Bishop-Lilly", "given": "Kimberly A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Mokashi", "given": "Vishwesh P", "initials": "VP"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6stedt", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hinrichs", "given": "Steven H", "initials": "SH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "66", "issn": "1466-5034", "issue": "3", "pages": "1200-1205", "title": "Int.

The full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain ATCC VR-331T had 98.5\u2009% nucleotide identity to the cognate gene in F. tularensis, with the highest similarity to subspecies novicida. Phylogenetic trees of full-length 16S rRNA gene, gyrA and recA sequences from species of the genera Wolbachia (class Alphaproteobacteria) and Francisella (class Gammaproteobacteria) indicated that W. persica ATCC VR-331T was most closely related to members of the genus Francisella and not Wolbachia. Local collinear blocks within the chromosome of strain ATCC VR-331T had considerable similarity with F. tularensis subsp. novicida, but not with any Wolbachia strain. The genomes of strain ATCC VR-331T and F. tularensis subsp. novicida Utah 112T (\u2009=\u2009ATCC 15482T) contained an average nucleotide identity mean of 88.72\u2009% and median of 89.18\u2009%.

In contrast to the obligate intracellular genus Wolbachia, strain ATCC VR-331T and facultative intracellular Francisella can replicate in specialized cell-free media.

Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, due to both purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species.

Although the treatment is effective, most metastases progress to a castration-resistant and lethal state. To examine metastatic progression in the bone microenvironment, we implanted androgen-sensitive, androgen receptor-positive, and relatively slow-growing Dunning G (G) rat prostate tumor cells into the tibial bone marrow of fully immune-competent Copenhagen rats. We show that tumor establishment in the bone marrow was reduced compared with the prostate, and whereas androgen deprivation did not affect tumor establishment or growth in the bone, this was markedly reduced in the prostate. Moreover, we found that, with time, G tumor cells in the bone microenvironment progress to a more aggressive phenotype with increased growth rate, reduced androgen sensitivity, and increased metastatic capacity. Tumor cells in the bone marrow encounter lower androgen levels and a higher degree of hypoxia than at the primary site, which may cause high selective pressures and eventually contribute to the development of a new and highly aggressive tumor cell phenotype.

We show that the binuclear site of SMPDL3a is occupied by two Zn(2+) ions and that excess Zn(2+) leads to inhibition of enzyme activity through binding to additional sites. As an extension of recent biochemical work we uncovered that SMPDL3a catalyses the hydrolysis of several modified nucleotides that include cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine, cytidine diphosphate ethanolamine and ADP-ribose, but not the aSMase substrate, sphingomyelin. We subsequently determined the structure of SMPDL3a in complex with the product 5'-cytidine monophosphate (CMP), a structure that is consistent with several distinct coordination modes of the substrate/product in the active site during the reaction cycle. Based on the structure of CMP complexes, we propose a phosphoryl transfer mechanism for SMPDL3a.

In this comparative study, we used a combination of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiling, clone-based comparison, qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing to assess the bacterial community and acetogenic sub-community prevailing in high- and low-ammonia laboratory-scale digesters in order to delineate potential SAOB communities. Potential candidates identified were further tracked in a number of low-ammonia and high-ammonia laboratory-scale and large-scale digesters in order to reveal a potential function in SAO.\n\nAll methodical approaches revealed significant changes in the bacterial community composition concurrently with increasing ammonia and predominance of SAO. The acetogenic community under high ammonia conditions was revealed to be generally heterogeneous, but formed distinct phylogenetic clusters. The clusters differed clearly from those found under low-ammonia conditions and represented an acetogenic assemblage unique for biogas processes and recurring in a number of high-ammonia processes, indicating potential involvement in SAO.\n\nThe phylogenetic affiliation and population dynamics observed point to a key community, belonging mainly to the Clostridia class, in particular to the orders Clostridiales and Thermoanaerobacterales, which appear to specialise in SAO rather than being metabolically versatile. Overall, the results reported here provide evidence of functional importance of the bacterial families identified in high-ammonia systems and extend existing knowledge of bacterial and acetogenic assemblages at low and high ammonia levels. This information will be of help in monitoring and assessing the impacts on the SAOB community in order to identify characteristics of robust and productive high ammonia biogas processes.", "doi": "10.1186/s13068-016-0454-9", "pmid": "26925165", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "454"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4769498"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fb94ae6f65904c328ae523aa3f1d88d5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fb94ae6f65904c328ae523aa3f1d88d5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5a2d1c20d4184d36a6504df1d5c2ff85", "title": "Mechanistic Modeling of Pitavastatin Disposition in Sandwich-Cultured Human Hepatocytes: A Proteomics-Informed Bottom-Up Approach", "authors": [{"family": "Vildhede", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mateus", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Khan", "given": "E K", "initials": "EK"}, {"family": "Lai", "given": "Y", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Karlgren", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Artursson", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kjellsson", "given": "M C", "initials": "MC"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-02-26", "journal": {"volume": "44", "issn": "1521-009X", "issue": "4", "pages": "505-516", "title": "Drug Metab.

Although recent high-throughput studies have identified novel recurrent genetic lesions in adverse prognostic CLL, the mechanisms leading to relapse after FCR therapy are not completely understood. To gain insight into this issue, we performed whole-exome sequencing of sequential samples from 41 CLL patients who were uniformly treated with FCR but relapsed after a median of 2 years. In addition to mutations with known adverse-prognostic impact (TP53, NOTCH1, ATM, SF3B1, NFKBIE, and BIRC3), a large proportion of cases (19.5%) harbored mutations in RPS15, a gene encoding a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Extended screening, totaling 1119 patients, supported a role for RPS15 mutations in aggressive CLL, with one-third of RPS15-mutant cases also carrying TP53 aberrations. In most cases, selection of dominant, relapse-specific subclones was observed over time. However, RPS15 mutations were clonal before treatment and remained stable at relapse. Notably, all RPS15 mutations represented somatic missense variants and resided within a 7 amino-acid, evolutionarily conserved region. We confirmed the recently postulated direct interaction between RPS15 and MDM2/MDMX and transient expression of mutant RPS15 revealed defective regulation of endogenous p53 compared with wild-type RPS15. In summary, we provide novel insights into the heterogeneous genetic landscape of CLL relapsing after FCR treatment and highlight a novel mechanism underlying clinical aggressiveness involving a mutated ribosomal protein, potentially representing an early genetic lesion in CLL pathobiology.", "doi": "10.1182/blood-2015-10-674572", "pmid": "26675346", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Clinical Genomics Uppsala": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "blood-2015-10-674572"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4768426"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0603ff3a56f54a67a0b941ab23f31672.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0603ff3a56f54a67a0b941ab23f31672"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6e50279fe7d6427b87d96845eb20bd63", "title": "A Multiplex Protein Panel Applied to Cerebrospinal Fluid Reveals Three New Biomarker Candidates in ALS but None in Neuropathic Pain Patients", "authors": [{"family": "Lind", "given": "Anne Li", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Di", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Freyhult", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Bodolea", "given": "Constantin", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ekegren", "given": "Titti", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Gustafsson", "given": "Mats G", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Katila", "given": "Lenka", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bergquist", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Gordh", "given": "Torsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Kamali-Moghaddam", "given": "Masood", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2016-02-25", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "2", "pages": "e0149821", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0149821", "pmid": null, "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": "Technology development", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6e50279fe7d6427b87d96845eb20bd63.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6e50279fe7d6427b87d96845eb20bd63"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "84811189e6a44232a03d23193a6b9372", "title": "Bioelectric and Morphological Response of Liquid-Covered Human Airway Epithelial Calu-3 Cell Monolayer to Periodic Deposition of Colloidal 3-Mercaptopropionic-Acid Coated CdSe-CdS/ZnS Core-Multishell Quantum Dots.", "authors": [{"family": "Turdalieva", "given": "Aizat", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Solandt", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Shambetova", "given": "Nestan", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Hao", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Blom", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Brismar", "given": "Hjalmar", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zelenina", "given": "Marina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Fu", "given": "Ying", "initials": "Y"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-25", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "2", "pages": "e0149915", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Lung epithelial cells are extensively exposed to nanoparticles present in the modern urban environment.

We combined three analytical platforms - gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) - to validate a multi-platform approach for characterizing individual variation in the postprandial state. We analyzed the postprandial plasma metabolome by introducing, at three occasions, meal challenges on a usual diet, and 1.5 years later, on a modified background diet. The postprandial response was stable over time and largely independent of the background diet as revealed by all three analytical platforms. Coverage of the metabolome between NMR and GC-MS included more polar metabolites detectable only by NMR and more hydrophobic compounds detected by GC-MS. The variability across three separate testing occasions among the identified metabolites was in the range of 1.1-86% for GC-MS and 0.9-42% for NMR in the fasting state at baseline. For the LC-MS analysis, the coefficients of variation of the detected compounds in the fasting state at baseline were in the range of 2-97% for the positive and 4-69% for the negative mode. Multivariate analysis (MVA) of metabolites detected with GC-MS revealed that for both background diets, levels of postprandial amino acids and sugars increased whereas those of fatty acids decreased at 0.5 h after the meal was consumed, reflecting the expected response to the challenge meal. MVA of NMR data revealed increasing postprandial levels of amino acids and other organic acids together with decreasing levels of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, also independent of the background diet. Together these data show that the postprandial response to the same challenge meal was stable even though it was tested 1.5 years apart, and that it was largely independent of background diet.

However, transcriptomic data do not correlate perfectly with levels of expressed proteins due to effects of post-translational modifications and variations in turnover rates. In addition, high-resolution analysis is needed to characterize key transitions. In order to identify protein profiles across the developmental region of wood formation, an in-depth and tissue specific sampling was performed.\n\nWe examined protein profiles, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry system, in high-resolution tangential sections spanning all wood development zones in Populus tremula from undifferentiated cambium to mature phloem and xylem, including cell expansion and cell death zones. In total, we analyzed 482 sections, 20-160 \u03bcm thick, from four 47-year-old trees growing wild in Sweden. We obtained high quality expression profiles for 3,082 proteins exhibiting consistency across the replicates, considering that the trees were growing in an uncontrolled environment. A combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (OPLS) modeling and an enhanced stepwise linear modeling approach identified several major transitions in global protein expression profiles, pinpointing (for example) locations of the cambial division leading to phloem and xylem cells, and secondary cell wall formation zones. We also identified key proteins and associated pathways underlying these developmental landmarks. For example, many of the lignocellulosic related proteins were upregulated in the expansion to the early developmental xylem zone, and for laccases with a rapid decrease in early xylem zones. We observed upregulation of two forms of xylem cysteine protease (Potri.002G005700.1 and Potri.005G256000.2; Pt-XCP2.1) in early xylem and their downregulation in late maturing xylem. Our data also show that Pt-KOR1.3 (Potri.003G151700.2) exhibits an expression pattern that supports the hypothesis put forward in previous studies that this is a key xyloglucanase involved in cellulose biosynthesis in primary cell walls and reduction of cellulose crystallinity in secondary walls.\n\nOur novel multivariate approach highlights important processes and provides confirmatory insights into the molecular foundations of wood development.", "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-2458-z", "pmid": "26887814", "labels": {"Swedish Metabolomics Centre (SMC)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12864-016-2458-z"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4758094"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c1101eb867604d37b6e8ce7051cd822c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c1101eb867604d37b6e8ce7051cd822c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d48238f7395548c49a05f2682302195a", "title": "GeneiASE: Detection of condition-dependent and static allele-specific expression from RNA-seq data without haplotype information.", "authors": [{"family": "Edsg\u00e4rd", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Iglesias", "given": "Maria Jesus", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Reilly", "given": "Sarah-Jayne", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tornvall", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Odeberg", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Emanuelsson", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-18", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "21134", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Allele-specific expression (ASE) is the imbalance in transcription between maternal and paternal alleles at a locus and can be probed in single individuals using massively parallel DNA sequencing technology.

Such condition-dependent ASE could indicate a genetic variation with a functional role in the phenotypic difference. We investigated ASE through RNA-sequencing of primary white blood cells from eight human individuals before and after the controlled induction of an inflammatory response, and detected condition-dependent and static ASE at 211 and 13021 variants, respectively. We developed a method, GeneiASE, to detect genes exhibiting static or condition-dependent ASE in single individuals. GeneiASE performed consistently over a range of read depths and ASE effect sizes, and did not require phasing of variants to estimate haplotypes. We observed condition-dependent ASE related to the inflammatory response in 19 genes, and static ASE in 1389 genes.

Here we report the genome of Zostera marina (L.), the first, to our knowledge, marine angiosperm to be fully sequenced. This reveals unique insights into the genomic losses and gains involved in achieving the structural and physiological adaptations required for its marine lifestyle, arguably the most severe habitat shift ever accomplished by flowering plants. Key angiosperm innovations that were lost include the entire repertoire of stomatal genes, genes involved in the synthesis of terpenoids and ethylene signalling, and genes for ultraviolet protection and phytochromes for far-red sensing. Seagrasses have also regained functions enabling them to adjust to full salinity. Their cell walls contain all of the polysaccharides typical of land plants, but also contain polyanionic, low-methylated pectins and sulfated galactans, a feature shared with the cell walls of all macroalgae and that is important for ion homoeostasis, nutrient uptake and O2/CO2 exchange through leaf epidermal cells. The Z. marina genome resource will markedly advance a wide range of functional ecological studies from adaptation of marine ecosystems under climate warming, to unravelling the mechanisms of

gene are linked to obesity, but how these SNPs influence resting-state neural activation is unknown. Few brain-imaging studies have investigated the influence of obesity-related SNPs on neural activity, and no study has investigated resting-state connectivity patterns. We tested connectivity within three, main resting-state networks: default mode (DMN), sensorimotor (SMN), and salience network (SN) in 30 male participants, grouped based on genotype for the rs9939609 FTO SNP, as well as punishment and reward sensitivity measured by the Behavioral Inhibition (BIS) and Behavioral Activation System (BAS) questionnaires. Because obesity is associated with anomalies in both systems, we calculated a BIS/BAS ratio (BBr) accounting for features of both scores. A prominence of BIS over BAS (higher BBr) resulted in increased connectivity in frontal and paralimbic regions. These alterations were more evident in the obesity-associated AA genotype, where a high BBr was also associated with increased SN connectivity in dopaminergic circuitries, and in a subnetwork involved in somatosensory integration regarding food. Participants with AA genotype and high BBr, compared to corresponding participants in the TT genotype, also showed greater DMN connectivity in regions involved in the processing of food cues, and in the SMN for regions involved in visceral perception and reward-based learning. These findings suggest that neural connectivity patterns influence the sensitivity toward punishment and reward more closely in the AA carriers, predisposing them to developing obesity. Our work explains a complex interaction between genetics, neural patterns, and behavioral measures in determining the risk for obesity and may help develop individually-tailored strategies for obesity prevention.", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2016.00052", "pmid": "26924971", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4756146"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7fb65ac3ee7d4e97aceaa5003f82e4ec.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7fb65ac3ee7d4e97aceaa5003f82e4ec"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bde3850ebd49416aafc9e88de78082ef", "title": "Genomic comparison of Escherichia coli serotype O103:H2 isolates with and without verotoxin genes: implications for risk assessment of strains commonly found in ruminant reservoirs.", "authors": [{"family": "S\u00f6derlund", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hurel", "given": "Julie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jinnerot", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sekse", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Asp\u00e1n", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Bongcam-Rudloff", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-16", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2000-8686", "issue": null, "pages": "30246", "title": "Infect Ecol Epidemiol"}, "abstract": "Escherichia coli O103:H2 occurs as verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) carrying only vtx 1 or vtx 2 or both variants, but also as vtx-negative atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC).

In this study, we have characterized and compared aEPEC and VTEC isolates of E. coli O103:H2 from Swedish cattle.\n\nFourteen isolates of E. coli O103:H2 with and without verotoxin genes were collected from samples of cattle feces taken during a nationwide cattle prevalence study 2011-2012. Isolates were sequenced with a 2\u00d7100 bp setup on a HiSeq2500 instrument producing >100\u00d7 coverage per isolate. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing was performed using the genome analysis tool kit (GATK). Virulence genes and other regions of interest were detected. Susceptibility to transduction by two verotoxin-encoding phages was investigated for one representative aEPEC O103:H2 isolate.\n\nThis study shows that aEPEC O103:H2 is more commonly found (64%) than VTEC O103:H2 (36%) in the Swedish cattle reservoir. The only verotoxin gene variant identified was vtx 1a . Phylogenetic comparison by SNP analysis indicates that while certain subgroups of aEPEC and VTEC are closely related and have otherwise near identical virulence gene repertoires, they belong to separate lineages. This indicates that the uptake or loss of verotoxin genes is a rare event in the natural cattle environment of these bacteria. However, a representative of a VTEC-like aEPEC O103:H2 subgroup could be stably lysogenized by a vtx-encoding phage in vitro.", "doi": "10.3402/iee.v6.30246", "pmid": "26895282", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "30246"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4759829"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bde3850ebd49416aafc9e88de78082ef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bde3850ebd49416aafc9e88de78082ef"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9a67034aa4ed41208ca6a1b06517d09d", "title": "Genomic inference of the metabolism of cosmopolitan subsurface Archaea, Hadesarchaea.", "authors": [{"family": "Baker", "given": "Brett J", "initials": "BJ"}, {"family": "Saw", "given": "Jimmy H", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Lind", "given": "Anders E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Lazar", "given": "Cassandre Sara", "initials": "CS"}, {"family": "Hinrichs", "given": "Kai-Uwe", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Teske", "given": "Andreas P", "initials": "AP"}, {"family": "Ettema", "given": "Thijs J G", "initials": "TJG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-15", "journal": {"volume": "1", "issn": "2058-5276", "issue": null, "pages": "16002", "title": "Nat Microbiol"}, "abstract": "The subsurface biosphere is largely unexplored and contains a broad diversity of uncultured microbes(1).

Four high-quality (63-90% complete) genomes were obtained from White Oak River estuary and Yellowstone National Park hot spring sediment metagenomes. Phylogenomic analyses place SAGMEG Archaea as a deeply rooting sister clade of the Thermococci, leading us to propose the name Hadesarchaea for this new Archaeal class. With an estimated genome size of around 1.5\u2005Mbp, the genomes of Hadesarchaea are distinctly streamlined, yet metabolically versatile. They share several physiological mechanisms with strict anaerobic Euryarchaeota. Several metabolic characteristics make them successful in the subsurface, including genes involved in CO and H2 oxidation (or H2 production), with potential coupling to nitrite reduction to ammonia (DNRA).

To investigate a possible association between GDF-15 levels and DNA methylation, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study of white blood cells in a population-based study (N = 717).

We have previously identified a virulence determinant, protein sHIP, which is secreted at higher levels by an invasive compared to a non-invasive strain of S. pyogenes. The present work presents a further characterization of the structural and functional properties of this bacterial protein. Biophysical and structural studies have shown that protein sHIP forms stable tetramers both in the crystal and in solution. The tetramers are composed of four helix-loop-helix motifs with the loop regions connecting the helices displaying a high degree of flexibility. Owing to interactions at the tetramer interface, the observed tetramer can be described as a dimer of dimers. We identified three residues at the tetramer interface (Leu84, Leu88, Tyr95), which due to largely non-polar side-chains, could be important determinants for protein oligomerization. Based on these observations, we produced a sHIP variant in which these residues were mutated to alanines. Biophysical experiments clearly indicated that the sHIP mutant appear only as dimers in solution confirming the importance of the interfacial residues for protein oligomerisation. Furthermore, we could show that the sHIP mutant interacts with intact histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and the histidine-rich repeats in HRG, and inhibits their antibacterial activity to the same or even higher extent as compared to the wild type protein sHIP. We determined the crystal structure of the sHIP mutant, which, as a result of the high quality of the data, allowed us to improve the existing structural model of the protein. Finally, by employing NMR spectroscopy in solution, we generated a model for the complex between the sHIP mutant and an HRG-derived heparin-binding peptide, providing further molecular details into the interactions involving protein sHIP.", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2016.00095", "pmid": "26903974", "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4742562"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/faf22fbbc4be4c7ba8ecf60306d7fa01.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/faf22fbbc4be4c7ba8ecf60306d7fa01"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "31ea5863739a459198d553aad06f3aaa", "title": "Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group to Nephrozoa.", "authors": [{"family": "Cannon", "given": "Johanna Taylor", "initials": "JT"}, {"family": "Vellutini", "given": "Bruno Cossermelli", "initials": "BC"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Julian", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ronquist", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Jondelius", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Hejnol", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-04", "journal": {"volume": "530", "issn": "1476-4687", "issue": "7588", "pages": "89-93", "title": "Nature"}, "abstract": "The position of Xenacoelomorpha in the tree of life remains a major unresolved question in the study of deep animal relationships. Xenacoelomorpha, comprising Acoela, Nemertodermatida, and Xenoturbella, are bilaterally symmetrical marine worms that lack several features common to most other bilaterians, for example an anus, nephridia, and a circulatory system. Two conflicting hypotheses are under debate: Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group to all remaining Bilateria (=\u2009Nephrozoa, namely protostomes and deuterostomes) or is a clade inside Deuterostomia. Thus, determining the phylogenetic position of this clade is pivotal for understanding the early evolution of bilaterian features, or as a case of drastic secondary loss of complexity. Here we show robust phylogenomic support for Xenacoelomorpha as the sister taxon of Nephrozoa. Our phylogenetic analyses, based on 11 novel xenacoelomorph transcriptomes and using different models of evolution under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, strongly corroborate this result. Rigorous testing of 25 experimental data sets designed to exclude data partitions and taxa potentially prone to reconstruction biases indicates that long-branch attraction, saturation, and missing data do not influence these results. The sister group relationship between Nephrozoa and Xenacoelomorpha supported by our phylogenomic analyses implies that the last common ancestor of bilaterians was probably a benthic, ciliated acoelomate worm with a single opening into an epithelial gut, and that excretory organs, coelomic cavities, and nerve cords evolved after xenacoelomorphs separated from the stem lineage of Nephrozoa.", "doi": "10.1038/nature16520", "pmid": "26842059", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics

One mechanism that, especially in high-energy trauma, could be of importance is cavitation. Cavitation can be described as a process of vaporization, bubble generation, and bubble implosion as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in pressure. Cavitation as an injury mechanism is difficult to visualize and model due to its short duration and limited spatial distribution. One strategy to analyze the cellular response of cavitation is to employ suitable in vitro models. The flyer-plate model is an in vitro high-energy trauma model that includes cavitation as a trauma mechanism. A copper fragment is accelerated by means of a laser, hits the bottom of a cell culture well causing cavitation, and shock waves inside the well and cell medium. We have found the flyer-plate model to be efficient, reproducible, and easy to control. In this study, we have used the model to analyze the cellular response to microcavitation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, Caco-2, and C6 glioma cell lines. Mitotic activity in neuroblastoma and glioma was investigated with BrdU staining, and cell numbers were calculated using automated time-lapse imaging. We found variations between cell types and between different zones surrounding the lesion with these methods. It was also shown that the injured cell cultures released S-100B in a dose-dependent manner. Using gene expression microarray, a number of gene families of potential interest were found to be strongly, but differently regulated in neuroblastoma and glioma at 24\u2009h post trauma. The data from the gene expression arrays may be used to identify new candidates for biomarkers in cavitation trauma. We conclude that our model is useful for studies of trauma in vitro and that it could be applied in future treatment studies.", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2016.00010", "pmid": "26869990", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4734234"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c18f07e8b1dd4809882f3763d679326e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c18f07e8b1dd4809882f3763d679326e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c20f0bcf05514700a52f34b7a89cd0f4", "title": "Proteome-wide survey of the autoimmune target repertoire in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1.", "authors": [{"family": "Landegren", "given": "Nils", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sharon", "given": "Donald", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Freyhult", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hallgren", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Edqvist", "given": "Per-Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Bensing", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wahlberg", "given": "Jeanette", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nelson", "given": "Lawrence M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Gustafsson", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Husebye", "given": "Eystein S", "initials": "ES"}, {"family": "Anderson", "given": "Mark S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Snyder", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "K\u00e4mpe", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}], "type": "clinical trial", "published": "2016-02-01", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "20104", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1) is a monogenic disorder that features multiple autoimmune disease manifestations.

We here used proteome arrays to perform a comprehensive study of autoimmune targets in APS1. Interrogation of established autoantigens revealed highly reliable detection of autoantibodies, and by exploring the full panel of more than 9000 proteins we further identified MAGEB2 and PDILT as novel major autoantigens in APS1. Our proteome-wide assessment revealed a marked enrichment for tissue-specific immune targets, mirroring AIRE's selectiveness for this category of genes. Our findings also suggest that only a very limited portion of the proteome becomes targeted by the immune system in APS1, which contrasts the broad defect of thymic presentation associated with

Although rare mutations in the leptin (LEP) gene are well known to cause leptin deficiency and severe obesity, no common loci regulating circulating leptin levels have been uncovered. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating leptin levels from 32,161 individuals and followed up loci reaching P<10(-6) in 19,979 additional individuals. We identify five loci robustly associated (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)) with leptin levels in/near LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL1 and FTO. Although the association of the FTO obesity locus with leptin levels is abolished by adjustment for BMI, associations of the four other loci are independent of adiposity. The GCKR locus was found associated with multiple metabolic traits in previous GWAS and the CCNL1 locus with birth weight. Knockdown experiments in mouse adipose tissue explants show convincing evidence for adipogenin, a regulator of adipocyte differentiation, as the novel causal gene in the SLC32A1 locus influencing leptin levels.

The aims were to characterize the enzymatic activities of EHA25900 and to identify crucial amino acids for the stereospecificity. Recombinant EHA25900 oxidized 18:2n-6 sequentially to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE) and to a 9R(10)-allene oxide. 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS catalyze abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C-11, but the direction of oxygen insertion differs. A comparison between twelve 9-DOX domains of 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS revealed conserved amino acid differences, which could contribute to the chirality of products. The Gly616Ile replacement of 9R-DOX-AOS (A. niger) increased the biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide, whereas the Phe627Leu replacement led to biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide as main products. The double mutant (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) formed over 90% of the 9S stereoisomer of HPODE. 9S-HPODE was formed by antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion, i.e., the original H-abstraction was retained but the product chirality was altered.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci associated with body fat distribution. The objectives of the current study are to examine whether genes in genetic loci linked to fat distribution can be linked to fat cell size and number (morphology) and/or adipose tissue function. We show, in a cohort of 114 women, that almost half of the 96 genes in these loci are indeed associated with abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue parameters. Thus, adipose mRNA expression of the genes is strongly related to adipose morphology, catecholamine-induced lipid mobilization (lipolysis), or insulin-stimulated lipid synthesis in adipocytes (lipogenesis). In conclusion, the genetic influence on body fat distribution could be mediated via several specific alterations in adipose tissue morphology and function, which in turn may influence the development of type 2 diabetes.", "doi": "10.2337/db15-0828", "pmid": "26798124", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "65/2/433"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/20c8fbffe3b4484db643be1fb008c3ac.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/20c8fbffe3b4484db643be1fb008c3ac"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3b4f402440494d2f9d0613dcaa707900", "title": "Decreased levels of stem cell factor in subjects with incident coronary events.", "authors": [{"family": "Wigren", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rattik", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hultman", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkbacka", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Nordin-Fredrikson", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bengtsson", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hedblad", "given": "B", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Siegbahn", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Gon\u00e7alves", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "279", "issn": "1365-2796", "issue": "2", "pages": "180-191", "title": "J.

Vascular endothelial growth factor A, placental growth factor and stem cell factor (SCF) are three growth factors that are important in recruiting vascular progenitor cells. In this study, we investigated the association between the plasma levels of these growth factors and incident coronary events (CEs).\n\nLevels of the three growth factors were measured using the proximity extension assay technique in baseline plasma samples from 384 subjects with a first CE (mean follow-up 14.0 \u00b1 4.3 years) and 409 event-free control subjects matched by sex and age, as well as in homogenates from 201 endarterectomy specimens.\n\nAfter controlling for known cardiovascular disease risk factors in a Cox regression model, subjects in the lowest SCF tertile had a hazard ratio of 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.14-2.54) compared with subjects in the highest SCF tertile. Lower SCF levels were also associated with more severe carotid disease, less fibrous atherosclerotic plaques and an increased incidence of heart failure. Expression of the SCF receptor c-kit was demonstrated in the subendothelial layer and fibrous cap of human atherosclerotic plaques. Smokers and subjects with diabetes had decreased levels of SCF compared with control subjects.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to provide evidence to support a key role for SCF and progenitor cells in vascular repair.

We studied two unrelated families including three affected fetuses with Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, comparative genome hybridization and homozygosity mapping. All affected patients were shown to have a novel homozygous splice variant NM_024740.2: c.1173+2T>A in the ALG9 gene, encoding alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, involved in the formation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-glycosylation.

Mass spectrometric analysis showed an increase in monoglycosylated transferrin as compared with control tissues, confirming that this is a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Only three liveborn children with ALG9-CDG have been previously reported, all with missense variants. All three suffered from intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, microcephaly and renal cysts, but none had skeletal dysplasia. Our study shows that some pathogenic variants in ALG9 can present as a lethal skeletal dysplasia with visceral malformations as the most severe phenotype.

Analysis of CNV status in 4578 individuals with RA and 5457 controls indicated association of duplications in the FCGR3B gene in antibody-negative RA (P=0.002, OR=1.43). Deletion in FCGR3B was associated with increased risk of antibody-positive RA, consistently with previous reports (P=0.023, OR=1.23). A clear genotype-phenotype relationship was observed: CNV polymorphisms of the FCGR3A gene correlated to CD16A expression (encoded by FCGR3A) on CD8 T-cells. In conclusion, our method allows determining the CNV status of the FCGR locus, we identified association of CNV in FCGR3B to RA and showed a functional relationship between CNV in the FCGR3A gene and CD16A expression.", "doi": "10.1038/ejhg.2015.95", "pmid": "25966632", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ejhg201595"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4717214"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/89c1a3d0dc754a759b2f8370bc029bef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/89c1a3d0dc754a759b2f8370bc029bef"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8d33216c75b54bba9c14b587bfbd83b5", "title": "Regulatory mutations in TBX3 disrupt asymmetric hair pigmentation that underlies Dun camouflage color in horses.", "authors": [{"family": "Imsland", "given": "Freyja", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "McGowan", "given": "Kelly", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Rubin", "given": "Carl-Johan", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Henegar", "given": "Corneliu", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Elisabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Berglund", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schwochow", "given": "Doreen", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gustafson", "given": "Ulla", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Imsland", "given": "P\u00e1ll", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Lindblad-Toh", "given": "Kerstin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lindgren", "given": "Gabriella", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mikko", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Millon", "given": "Lee", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wade", "given": "Claire", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Schubert", "given": "Mikkel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Orlando", "given": "Ludovic", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Penedo", "given": "Maria Cecilia T", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "Barsh", "given": "Gregory S", "initials": "GS"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "48", "issn": "1546-1718", "issue": "2", "pages": "152-158", "title": "Nat.

Here we show that pigment dilution in Dun horses is due to radially asymmetric deposition of pigment in the growing hair caused by localized expression of the T-box 3 (TBX3) transcription factor in hair follicles, which in turn determines the distribution of hair follicle melanocytes. Most domestic horses are non-dun, a more intensely pigmented phenotype caused by regulatory mutations impairing TBX3 expression in the hair follicle, resulting in a more circumferential distribution of melanocytes and pigment granules in individual hairs. We identified two different alleles (non-dun1 and non-dun2) causing non-dun color. non-dun2 is a recently derived allele, whereas the Dun and non-dun1 alleles are found in ancient horse DNA, demonstrating that this polymorphism predates horse domestication.

The population genetic analyses revealed the existence of seven genetic groups in the past worldwide P. striiformis population. This genetic grouping generally corresponded with geographical sample origin except for the Middle East, where six of the seven genetic groups were represented. The presence of many genetic groups in the Middle Eastern population reflected a low differentiation from the populations in East Africa (FST=0.052) and in South Asia (FST=0.064). A high diversity and recombinant population structure was observed in China and South Asia, while a clonal population structure was observed in NW Europe, East Africa and the Mediterranean region. The high genetic diversity in the Himalayan region supported recent studies suggesting a putative center of diversity for P. striiformis in this area. Four of the 89 multilocus genotypes detected were resampled in different geographical regions suggesting long-distance migration in the past. Comparison of the past populations with more recent ones, represented by 309 isolates mainly collected between 2001 and 2009, revealed temporal divergence for all populations except for Northwest Europe.

The structure of PA4991 was determined by a combination of molecular replacement using a search model generated with Rosetta and phase improvement by a low-occupancy heavy-metal derivative. PA4991 belongs to the GR2 family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, comprising an FAD-binding domain typical of the glutathione reductase family and a second domain dominated by an eight-stranded mixed \u03b2-sheet. Most of the protein-FAD interactions are via the FAD-binding domain, but the isoalloxazine ring is located at the domain interface and interacts with residues from both domains. A comparison with the structurally related glycine oxidase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shows that in spite of very low amino-acid sequence identity (<18%) several active-site residues involved in substrate binding in these enzymes are conserved in PA4991.

The incorporated ibuprofen was found to be in an amorphous state and was physisorbed, rather than chemisorbed, to the surfaces of the pore walls. In contrast to ibuprofen in mesoporous silica, there was no detectable drug on the outer surface of the carrier particles. Two ibuprofen doses were loaded into Upsalite(\u00ae) particles with size fractions ranging from 25 \u03bcm to more than 200 \u03bcm. The initial release rate was controlled by the particle size; the dissolution rate of the loaded ibuprofen during this period was more than four times faster than that of the crystalline drug. An extended-release period of about 24 h followed the initial rapid-release period. The features of this extended-release period were dependent on the total drug concentration in the release medium. Detailed analysis of the diffusion of ibuprofen in Upsalite(\u00ae) provided the ibuprofen diffusion coefficient (9.8 \u00d7 10(-8) cm(2)/s), the constrictivity of the diffusion process (0.47) and the tortuosity of the carrier (15).

Six discovery cohorts including 13,312 samples were analyzed, followed by in-silico and de-novo replication studies including an additional 2,800 individuals. A total of 10 genome-wide significant variants were identified at 7 loci. Four were novel loci (5q14.3, 10q21.3, 16q24.2 and 18q22.3) and the leading variants at these loci were rs114694170 (MEF2C, P = 6.79 x 10(-13)), rs74506613 (JMJD1C, P = 1.17 x 10(-19)), rs4782371 (ZFPM1, P = 1.59 x 10(-9)) and rs2639990 (ZADH2, P = 1.72 x 10(-8)), respectively.

The bay barnacle, Balanus improvisus (= Amphibalanus improvisus), is one of the most successful aquatic invaders worldwide, and is characterised by broad environmental tolerance. Although the species can spread through natural larval dispersal, human-mediated transport through (primarily) shipping has almost certainly contributed to the current global distribution of this species. Despite its worldwide distribution, little is known about the phylogeography of this species. Here, we characterize the population genetic structure and model dispersal dynamics of the barnacle B. improvisus, and describe how human-mediated spreading via shipping as well as natural larval dispersal may have contributed to observed genetic variation. We used both mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I: COI) and nuclear microsatellites to characterize the genetic structure in 14 populations of B. improvisus on a global and regional scale (Baltic Sea). Genetic diversity was high in most populations, and many haplotypes were shared among populations on a global scale, indicating that long-distance dispersal (presumably through shipping and other anthropogenic activities) has played an important role in shaping the population genetic structure of this cosmopolitan species. We could not clearly confirm prior claims that B. improvisus originates from the western margins of the Atlantic coasts; although there were indications that Argentina could be part of a native region. In addition to dispersal via shipping, we show that natural larval dispersal may play an important role for further colonisation following initial introduction.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0147082", "pmid": "26821161", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-15-22808"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4731558"}, {"db": "Dryad", "key": "SF2V0"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d435f0bee53447ae9e14cabd972bdfbe.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d435f0bee53447ae9e14cabd972bdfbe"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0a636ef1f1294f3e95502f73cdace59e", "title": "Genomic sequencing of a dyslexia susceptibility haplotype encompassing ROBO1.", "authors": [{"family": "Massinen", "given": "Satu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Jingwen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Laivuori", "given": "Krista", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bieder", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tapia Paez", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Jiao", "given": "Hong", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Kere", "given": "Juha", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-27", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1866-1947", "issue": null, "pages": "4", "title": "J Neurodev Disord"}, "abstract": "The DYX5 locus for developmental dyslexia was mapped to chromosome 3 by linkage study of a large Finnish family, and later, roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) was implicated as a candidate gene at DYX5 with suppressed expression from the segregating rare haplotype.

We have combined site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays with a structural dynamics analysis to probe the functional roles of such putative catalytic residues. We found that Ser-127 is not required for activity, whereas an interaction between Arg-126 and Asp-49 is essential for catalysis. We postulate that both residues, in addition to a crystallographic water, serve critical roles within the enzymatic mechanism. After characterizing the size or charge conservative mutations Arg-126-Gln, Asp-49-Asn, and Arg-126-Lys, we inferred that a crystallographic water acts as a general base during GSH thiolate formation, stabilized by interaction with Arg-126, which is itself modulated by its respective interaction with Asp-49. We subsequently found hidden conformational ensembles within the crystal structure that correlate well with our biochemical data. The resulting contact signaling network connects Asp-49 to distal residues involved in GSH binding and is ligand dependent.

We present ancient genome-wide sequence data from 6,700-year-old human remains excavated from a Neolithic context in Kumtepe, located in northwestern Anatolia near the well-known (and younger) site Troy [10]. Kumtepe is one of the settlements that emerged around 7,000 BP, after the initial expansion wave brought Neolithic practices to Europe. We show that this individual displays genetic similarities to the early European Neolithic gene pool and modern-day Sardinians, as well as a genetic affinity to modern-day populations from the Near East and the Caucasus. Furthermore, modern-day Anatolians carry signatures of several admixture events from different populations that have diluted this early Neolithic farmer component, explaining why modern-day Sardinian populations, instead of modern-day Anatolian populations, are genetically more similar to the people that drove the Neolithic expansion into Europe.

associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), combining data across 133,413 individuals with replication in up to 42,166 individuals. We identify 24 new and confirm 29 previously identified loci. Of these 53 loci, 19 associate with eGFR among individuals with diabetes. Using bioinformatics, we show that identified genes at eGFR loci are enriched for expression in kidney tissues and in pathways relevant for kidney development and transmembrane transporter activity, kidney structure, and regulation of glucose metabolism. Chromatin state mapping and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses across adult tissues demonstrate preferential mapping of associated variants to regulatory regions in kidney but not extra-renal tissues. These findings suggest that genetic determinants of eGFR are mediated largely through direct effects within the kidney and highlight important cell types and biological pathways.", "doi": "10.1038/ncomms10023", "pmid": "26831199", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ncomms10023"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4735748"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS733914"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dfe06efb3c6746b1ba351aec04047a2f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dfe06efb3c6746b1ba351aec04047a2f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2288e935047e4fcb944ad7015d745e73", "title": "Backbone Assignment of the MALT1 Paracaspase by Solution NMR.", "authors": [{"family": "Unnerst\u00e5le", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nowakowski", "given": "Michal", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Baraznenok", "given": "Vera", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Stenberg", "given": "Gun", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Jimmy", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mayzel", "given": "Maxim", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Orekhov", "given": "Vladislav", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Agback", "given": "Tatiana", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-20", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "1", "pages": "e0146496", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a unique paracaspase protein whose protease activity mediates oncogenic NF-\u03baB signalling in activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs).

High nutrient input and low water exchange result in eutrophication and oxygen depletion below the halocline. As a consequence at Landsort Deep, the deepest point of the Baltic Sea, anoxia in the sediments has been a persistent condition over the past decades. Given that microbial communities are drivers of essential ecosystem functions we investigated the microbial community metabolisms and functions of oxygen depleted Landsort Deep sediments by metatranscriptomics. Results show substantial expression of genes involved in protein metabolism demonstrating that the Landsort Deep sediment microbial community is active. Identified expressed gene suites of metabolic pathways with importance for carbon transformation including fermentation, dissimilatory sulphate reduction and methanogenesis were identified. The presence of transcripts for these metabolic processes suggests a potential for heterotrophic-autotrophic community synergism and indicates active mineralisation of the organic matter deposited at the sediment as a consequence of the eutrophication process. Furthermore, cyanobacteria, probably deposited from the water column, are transcriptionally active in the anoxic sediment at this depth. Results also reveal high abundance of transcripts encoding integron integrases. These results provide insight into the activity of the microbial community of the anoxic sediment at the deepest point of the Baltic Sea and its possible role in ecosystem functioning.", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.1593", "pmid": "26823996", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1593"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4730985"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/06a7f813e778488ca2802234eb311211.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/06a7f813e778488ca2802234eb311211"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "286b13fc6ef24578a812eb2c5d75d4a0", "title": "Genetic Determinants of Thrombin Generation and Their Relation to Venous Thrombosis: Results from the GAIT-2 Project.", "authors": [{"family": "Martin-Fernandez", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ziyatdinov", "given": "Andrey", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Carrasco", "given": "Marina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Millon", "given": "Juan Antonio", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Martinez-Perez", "given": "Angel", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vilalta", "given": "Noelia", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Brunel", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Font", "given": "Montserrat", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Souto", "given": "Juan Carlos", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Soria", "given": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel", "initials": "JM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-19", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "1", "pages": "e0146922", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease where known genetic risk factors explain only a small portion of the genetic variance.

We performed also genome wide association studies (GWAS) with thrombin generation phenotypes.\n\nThe results showed that 67% of the variation in the risk of VTE is attributable to genetic factors. The heritabilities of lag time, thrombin peak and ETP were 49%, 54% and 52%, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated also the existence of positive genetic correlations between thrombin peak or ETP and the risk of VTE. Moreover, the major genetic determinant of thrombin generation was the F2 gene. However, other suggestive signals were observed.\n\nThe thrombin generation phenotypes are strongly genetically determined. The thrombin peak and ETP are significantly genetically correlated with the risk of VTE. In addition, F2 was identified as a major determinant of thrombin generation. We reported suggestive signals that might increase our knowledge to explain the variability of this important phenotype. Validation and functional studies are required to confirm GWAS results.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0146922", "pmid": "26784699", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-15-50489"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4718515"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/286b13fc6ef24578a812eb2c5d75d4a0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/286b13fc6ef24578a812eb2c5d75d4a0"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "60966b70bcd3484bb57f7920104db3a7", "title": "Geographical distribution of genetic diversity in Secale landrace and wild accessions.", "authors": [{"family": "Hagenblad", "given": "Jenny", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Oliveira", "given": "Hugo R", "initials": "HR"}, {"family": "Forsberg", "given": "Nils E G", "initials": "NE"}, {"family": "Leino", "given": "Matti W", "initials": "MW"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-19", "journal": {"volume": "16", "issn": "1471-2229", "issue": null, "pages": "23", "title": "BMC Plant Biol."}, "abstract": "Rye, Secale cereale L., has historically been a crop of major importance and is still a key cereal in many parts of Europe. Single populations of cultivated rye have been shown to capture a large proportion of the genetic diversity present in the species, but the distribution of genetic diversity in subspecies and across geographical areas is largely unknown. Here we explore the structure of genetic diversity in landrace rye and relate it to that of wild and feral relatives.\n\nA total of 567 SNPs were analysed in 434 individuals from 76 accessions of wild, feral and cultivated rye. Genetic diversity was highest in cultivated rye, slightly lower in feral rye taxa and significantly lower in the wild S. strictum Presl. and S. africanum Stapf. Evaluation of effects from ascertainment bias suggests underestimation of diversity primarily in S. strictum and S. africanum. Levels of ascertainment bias, STRUCTURE and principal component analyses all supported the proposed classification of S. africanum and S. strictum as a separate species from S. cereale. S. afghanicum (Vav.) Roshev, S. ancestrale Zhuk., S. dighoricum (Vav.) Roshev, S. segetale (Zhuk.) Roshev and S. vavilovii Grossh. seemed, in contrast, to share the same gene pool as S. cereale and their genetic clustering was more dependent on geographical origin than taxonomic classification. S. vavilovii was found to be the most likely wild ancestor of cultivated rye. Among cultivated rye landraces from Europe, Asia and North Africa five geographically discrete genetic clusters were identified. These had only limited overlap with major agro-climatic zones. Slash-and-burn rye from the Finnmark area in Scandinavia formed a distinct cluster with little similarity to other landrace ryes. Regional studies of Northern and South-West Europe demonstrate different genetic distribution patterns as a result of varying cultivation intensity.\n\nWith the exception of S. strictum and S. africanum different rye taxa share the majority of the genetic variation. Due to the vast sharing of genetic diversity within the S. cereale clade, ascertainment bias seems to be a lesser problem in rye than in predominantly selfing species. By exploiting within accession diversity geographic structure can be shown on a much finer scale than previously reported.", "doi": "10.1186/s12870-016-0710-y", "pmid": "26786820", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12870-016-0710-y"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4719562"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/60966b70bcd3484bb57f7920104db3a7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/60966b70bcd3484bb57f7920104db3a7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "77da5ef1c8c94bc48cce4fe25d028fe4", "title": "Chondroitin sulfate coated gold nanoparticles: a new strategy to resolve multidrug resistance and thromboinflammation.", "authors": [{"family": "Gurav", "given": "Deepanjali", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Varghese", "given": "Oommen P", "initials": "OP"}, {"family": "Hamad", "given": "Osama A", "initials": "OA"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Hilborn", "given": "J\u00f6ns", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Oommen", "given": "Oommen P", "initials": "OP"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-18", "journal": {"volume": "52", "issn": "1364-548X", "issue": "5", "pages": "966-969", "title": "Chem.

The p53-induced RBP Wig-1 (Zmat3) binds RNA through its zinc finger domains and enhances stability of p53 and N-Myc mRNAs and decreases stability of FAS mRNA. To identify novel Wig-1-bound RNAs, we performed RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (RIP-Seq) in HCT116 and Saos-2 cells. We identified 286 Wig-1-bound mRNAs common between the two cell lines. Sequence analysis revealed that AU-rich elements (AREs) are highly enriched in the 3'UTR of these Wig-1-bound mRNAs. Network enrichment analysis showed that Wig-1 preferentially binds mRNAs involved in cell cycle regulation. Moreover, we identified a 2D Wig-1 binding motif in HIF1A mRNA.

This gene is found to be associated with several human neurological disorders. Early expression of QKI proteins in the developing mouse neuroepithelium, together with neural tube defects in Qk mouse mutants, suggest the functional requirement of Qk for the establishment of the nervous system. As a knockout of Qk is embryonic lethal in mice, other model systems like the zebrafish could serve as a tool to study the developmental functions of qki. In the present study we sought to characterize the evolutionary relationship and spatiotemporal expression of qkia, qki2, and qkib; zebrafish homologs of human QKI. We found that qkia is an ancestral paralog of the single tetrapod Qk gene that was likely lost during the fin-to-limb transition. Conversely, qkib and qki2 are orthologs, emerging at the root of the vertebrate and teleost lineage, respectively. Both qki2 and qkib, but not qkia, were expressed in the progenitor domains of the central nervous system, similar to expression of the single gene in mice. Despite having partially overlapping expression domains, each gene has a unique expression pattern, suggesting that these genes have undergone subfunctionalization following duplication.

Because the technique is so easy and efficient in zebrafish, the most valuable asset is no longer a mutated fish (which has distribution challenges), but rather a CRISPR/Cas9 target sequence to the gene confirmed to have high mutagenic efficiency. With a highly active CRISPR target, a mutant fish can be quickly replicated in any genetic background anywhere in the world. However, sgRNA's vary widely in their activity and models for predicting target activity are imperfect. Thus, it is very useful to collect in one place validated CRISPR target sequences with their relative mutagenic activities.

In fact, cellulose acetates with different properties could be obtained in half an hour, thus facilitating rapid processing. When DBN was used as the dispersing agent (the precursor of the ionic liquid), the problems associated with recycling of the ionic liquid were significantly reduced. In fact, additional [HDBN][OAc] was obtained from the interaction of the DBN and the by-product, acetic acid (from Ac2O). However, the cellulose acetate obtained in this manner had the lowest DS.

In a relatively large part of patients with a few or multiple colorectal polyps the underlying genetic cause of the disease is still unknown. Using exome sequencing in combination with linkage analyses together with detection of copy-number variations (CNV), we have identified a duplication in the regulatory region of the GREM1 gene in a family with an attenuated/atypical polyposis syndrome. In addition, 107 patients with colorectal cancer and/or polyposis were analyzed for mutations in the candidate genes identified. We also performed screening of the exonuclease domain of the POLE gene in a subset of these patients. The duplication of 16 kb in the regulatory region of GREM1 was found to be disease-causing in the family. Functional analyses revealed a higher expression of the GREM1 gene in colorectal tissue in duplication carriers. Screening of the exonuclease domain of POLE in additional CRC patients identified a probable causative novel variant c.1274A>G, p.Lys425Arg. In conclusion a high penetrant duplication in the regulatory region of GREM1, predisposing to CRC, was identified in a family with attenuated/atypical polyposis.

Therefore, we sought to implement a super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy protocol for the study of the filtration barrier in the kidney.

Further bioinformatic analysis of the SNP array data disclosed genetic heterogeneity, in the form of subclonal chromosomal imbalances, in five tumors.

The relative abundances of bacteria belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae, and more specifically its two genera Dorea and Coprococcus, were significantly higher among those who remained uninfected. The travel-related infection did not significantly modify the faecal microbiota composition. Species composition of human gut microbiota is important for colonization resistance to Campylobacter infection. Especially individuals with a lower diversity are more susceptible to Campylobacter infection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmi.2015.09.004", "pmid": "26369602", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service", "Clinical Genomics Stockholm": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1198-743X(15)00819-8"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bf5c2ea2906c4e23b6b43047310133b9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bf5c2ea2906c4e23b6b43047310133b9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bf8296e787394b88a63351bd49943daa", "title": "Fat intake and breast milk fatty acid composition in farming and nonfarming women and allergy development in the offspring.", "authors": [{"family": "Jonsson", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Barman", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Moberg", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6berg", "given": "Agneta", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Brekke", "given": "Hilde K", "initials": "HK"}, {"family": "Hesselmar", "given": "Bill", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Johansen", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wold", "given": "Agnes E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Ann-Sofie", "initials": "AS"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2016-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "79", "issn": "1530-0447", "issue": "1-1", "pages": "114-123", "title": "Pediatr.

We considered longitudinal grip strength measurements in seven twin studies of aging in the Interplay of Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies consortium. Growth curve parameters were estimated for same-sex pairs, aged 34-99 (N\u00a0=\u00a010,681). Fisher's test for mixture distribution of within-monozygotic twin-pair differences (N\u00a0=\u00a01724) was performed on growth curve parameters.

Arabidopsis thaliana contains five genes encoding MSI1-like proteins, but their functions in diverse chromatin-associated complexes are poorly understood.

We copurified HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) with MSI1 and transcriptional regulatory SIN3-like proteins and provide evidence that MSI1 and HDA19 associate into the same complex in vivo. These data suggest that MSI1, HDA19, and HISTONE DEACETYLATION COMPLEX1 protein form a core complex that can integrate various SIN3-like proteins. We found that reduction of MSI1 or HDA19 causes upregulation of abscisic acid (ABA) receptor genes and hypersensitivity of ABA-responsive genes. The MSI1-HDA19 complex fine-tunes ABA signaling by binding to the chromatin of ABA receptor genes and by maintaining low levels of acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, thereby affecting the expression levels of ABA receptor genes. Reduced MSI1 or HDA19 levels led to increased tolerance to salt stress corresponding to the increased ABA sensitivity of gene expression. Together, our results reveal the presence of an MSI1-HDA19 complex that fine-tunes ABA signaling in Arabidopsis.", "doi": "10.1105/tpc.15.00763", "pmid": "26704384", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "tpc.15.00763"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4746680"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d662b46c9b0845cfbb5fbc2f4c08f978.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d662b46c9b0845cfbb5fbc2f4c08f978"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dfc8c13fa784413eacd98b124c06f72a", "title": "Structural genomic changes underlie alternative reproductive strategies in the ruff (Philomachus pugnax).", "authors": [{"family": "Lamichhaney", "given": "Sangeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fan", "given": "Guangyi", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Widemo", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gunnarsson", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Thalmann", "given": "Doreen Schwochow", "initials": "DS"}, {"family": "Hoeppner", "given": "Marc P", "initials": "MP"}, {"family": "Kerje", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gustafson", "given": "Ulla", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Shi", "given": "Chengcheng", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "He", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Wenbin", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Liang", "given": "Xinming", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Leihuan", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Jiahao", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Liang", "given": "Enjing", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Qiong", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Simon Ming-Yuen", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Xun", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "H\u00f6glund", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Xin", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2016-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "48", "issn": "1546-1718", "issue": "1", "pages": "84-88", "title": "Nat.

This bird has one of the most remarkable mating systems in the animal kingdom, comprising three different male morphs (independents, satellites and faeders) that differ in behavior, plumage color and body size. Remarkably, the satellite and faeder morphs are controlled by dominant alleles. Here we have used whole-genome sequencing and resolved the enigma of how such complex phenotypic differences can have a simple genetic basis. The Satellite and Faeder alleles are both associated with a 4.5-Mb inversion that occurred about 3.8 million years ago. We propose an evolutionary scenario where the Satellite chromosome arose by a rare recombination event about 500,000 years ago.
