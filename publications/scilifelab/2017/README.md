The publications for year 2017 have been imported and checked by the
respective facility. No automated script was provided by the Data
Office.

The deadline for the first reporting round was 3 Nov 2017.

The CSV and JSON files were created on 6 Nov 2017.

The plan is to request further updates early 2018, and produce new CSV
and JSON files then.
