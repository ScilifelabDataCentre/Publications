We investigated possible relationships between five TPH1 gene polymorphisms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the major serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the major dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), and the major norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in healthy volunteers (n=132). The G-allele of the TPH1 rs4537731 (A-6526G) polymorphism was associated with 5-HIAA and HVA, but not MHPG concentrations. None of the other four TPH1 polymorphisms (rs211105, rs1800532, rs1799913 and rs7933505) were significantly associated with any of the monoamine metabolite concentrations. Two (rs4537731G/rs211105T/rs1800532C/rs1799913C/rs7933505G and rs4537731A/rs211105T/rs1800532C/rs1799913C/rs7933505G) of five common TPH1 five-allele haplotypes were associated with 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations in opposite directions.

Recently, the tools to analyse gene and protein expression on a whole-genome scale have been improved, including the availability of the new generation sequencing instruments and high-throughput antibody-based methods to analyze the presence and localization of proteins. In this study, we used massive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptome of a human osteosarcoma cell line and compared the expression levels with in situ protein data obtained in-situ from antibody-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF).\n\nA large-scale analysis based on 2749 genes was performed, corresponding to approximately 13% of the protein coding genes in the human genome. We found the presence of both RNA and proteins to a large fraction of the analyzed genes with 60% of the analyzed human genes detected by all three methods. Only 34 genes (1.2%) were not detected on the transcriptional or protein level with any method. Our data suggest that the majority of the human genes are expressed at detectable transcript or protein levels in this cell line. Since the reliability of antibodies depends on possible cross-reactivity, we compared the RNA and protein data using antibodies with different reliability scores based on various criteria, including Western blot analysis. Gene products detected in all three platforms generally have good antibody validation scores, while those detected only by antibodies, but not by RNA sequencing, generally consist of more low-scoring antibodies.\n\nThis suggests that some antibodies are staining the cells in an unspecific manner, and that assessment of transcript presence by RNA-seq can provide guidance for validation of the corresponding antibodies.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-11-684", "pmid": "21126332", "labels": {"Cell Profiling": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1471-2164-11-684"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3014981"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bbc4aa27752846dea221f0b103fdcdbf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bbc4aa27752846dea221f0b103fdcdbf"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d9d7334b5ed84f6997779557091c6c34", "title": "Associations of gene sequence variation and serum levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 with Alzheimer's disease and dementia.", "authors": [{"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Ulrika K", "initials": "UK"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Nancy L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Reynolds", "given": "Chandra A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Hong", "given": "Mun-Gwan", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Prince", "given": "Jonathan A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Gatz", "given": "Margaret", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Dickman", "given": "Paul W", "initials": "PW"}, {"family": "Bennet", "given": "Anna M", "initials": "AM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-12-01", "journal": {"volume": "23", "issn": "1875-8908", "issue": "2", "pages": "361-369", "title": "J.

None of the SNPs or haplotypes was significantly associated with AD or dementia after correcting for multiple testing nor were elevated baseline levels of hsCRP or IL6 (measured on average 4.3 years before dementia onset) significantly associated with risk of future AD or dementia. However, prevalent AD cases had higher levels of IL6 (measured on average 5.5 years after dementia onset) than age- and gender-matched controls, OR 2.24 (95% CI 1.27-3.95), p-value 0.006. In summary, this data suggests that AD patients have an altered immune profile with higher circulating levels of IL6 than age- and gender-matched controls.

Genetic factors affecting expression, turnover, and abnormal glycation of hemoglobin could also be associated with increased levels of HbA\u2081(c). We aimed to identify such genetic factors and investigate the extent to which they influence diabetes classification based on HbA\u2081(c) levels.\n\nWe studied associations with HbA\u2081(c) in up to 46,368 nondiabetic adults of European descent from 23 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 8 cohorts with de novo genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We combined studies using inverse-variance meta-analysis and tested mediation by glycemia using conditional analyses. We estimated the global effect of HbA\u2081(c) loci using a multilocus risk score, and used net reclassification to estimate genetic effects on diabetes screening.\n\nTen loci reached genome-wide significant association with HbA(1c), including six new loci near FN3K (lead SNP/P value, rs1046896/P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2076), HFE (rs1800562/P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070), TMPRSS6 (rs855791/P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074), ANK1 (rs4737009/P = 6.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2), SPTA1 (rs2779116/P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079) and ATP11A/TUBGCP3 (rs7998202/P = 5.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079), and four known HbA\u2081(c) loci: HK1 (rs16926246/P = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075\u2074), MTNR1B (rs1387153/P = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9), GCK (rs1799884/P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070) and G6PC2/ABCB11 (rs552976/P = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078). We show that associations with HbA\u2081(c) are partly a function of hyperglycemia associated with 3 of the 10 loci (GCK, G6PC2 and MTNR1B). The seven nonglycemic loci accounted for a 0.19 (% HbA\u2081(c)) difference between the extreme 10% tails of the risk score, and would reclassify \u223c2% of a general white population screened for diabetes with HbA\u2081(c).\n\nGWAS identified 10 genetic loci reproducibly associated with HbA\u2081(c). Six are novel and seven map to loci where rarer variants cause hereditary anemias and iron storage disorders. Common variants at these loci likely influence HbA\u2081(c) levels via erythrocyte biology, and confer a small but detectable reclassification of diabetes diagnosis by HbA\u2081(c).", "doi": "10.2337/db10-0502", "pmid": "20858683", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "db10-0502"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2992787"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/10110364b86746baa129d44062770482.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/10110364b86746baa129d44062770482"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3943cafd8d924224afc0aedc6b4c267e", "title": "A pyrosequencing study in twins shows that gastrointestinal microbial profiles vary with inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.", "authors": [{"family": "Willing", "given": "Ben P", "initials": "BP"}, {"family": "Dicksved", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Halfvarson", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Lucio", "given": "Marianna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zheng", "given": "Zongli", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rnerot", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Tysk", "given": "Curt", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Jansson", "given": "Janet K", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Engstrand", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "139", "issn": "1528-0012", "issue": "6", "pages": "1844-1854.e1", "title": "Gastroenterology"}, "abstract": "The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to have an important role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Expression patterns were determined in 106 primary tumors and 39 metastases in addition to 16 normal skin samples and six benign nevi employing immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. The immunohistochemical staining was evaluated manually and with an automated algorithm. SOX10 was strongly expressed in the benign tissues, but for the malignant tumors superficial spreading melanomas stained stronger than nodular malignant melanomas (P=0.008). The staining intensity was also inversely correlated with T-stage (Spearman's \u03c1=-0.261, P=0.008). Overall survival and time to recurrence were significantly correlated with SOX10 intensity, but not in multivariate analysis including T-stage. With the automated algorithm there was an inverse correlation between the SOX10 staining intensity and the proliferation marker, Ki-67 (\u03c1=-0.173, P=0.02) and a significant difference in the intensity signal between the benign tissues, the primary tumors and the metastases where the metastases stained the weakest (P\u22640.001).

In the case of pleiotropy, multiple quantitative trait loci are often taken to be pleiotropic if their confidence intervals overlap, without formal statistical tests being used to ascertain if these overlapping loci are statistically significantly pleiotropic. Additionally, the degree to which the genetic correlations between phenotypic traits are reflected in these pleiotropic quantitative trait loci is often variable, especially in the case of antagonistic pleiotropy. Similarly, the extent of epistasis in various morphological, behavioural and life-history traits is also debated, with a general problem being the sample sizes required to detect such effects. Domestication involves a large number of trade-offs, which are reflected in numerous behavioural, morphological and life-history traits which have evolved as a consequence of adaptation to selective pressures exerted by humans and captivity. The comparison between wild and domestic animals allows the genetic analysis of the traits that differ between these population types, as well as being a general model of evolution. Using a large F(2) intercross between wild and domesticated chickens, in combination with a dense SNP and microsatellite marker map, both pleiotropy and epistasis were analysed. The majority of traits were found to segregate in 11 tight 'blocks' and reflected the trade-offs associated with domestication. These blocks were shown to have a pleiotropic 'core' surrounded by more loosely linked loci. In contrast, epistatic interactions were almost entirely absent, with only six pairs identified over all traits analysed. These results give insights both into the extent of such blocks in evolution and the development of domestication itself.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04882.x", "pmid": "21040053", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9286df46be4c4a84a0e04830876a3b84.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9286df46be4c4a84a0e04830876a3b84"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ace41dfd8e0840279e4ac0c774e367a0", "title": "High frequency of p16(INK4A) promoter methylation in NRAS-mutated cutaneous melanoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Jonsson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tuominen", "given": "Rainer", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Grafstr\u00f6m", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Egyhazi", "given": "Suzanne", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "130", "issn": "1523-1747", "issue": "12", "pages": "2809-2817", "title": "J.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in individuals free of diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that whole-grain food intake and genetic variation interact to influence concentrations of fasting glucose and insulin.\n\nVia meta-analysis of data from 14 cohorts comprising \u223c 48,000 participants of European descent, we studied interactions of whole-grain intake with loci previously associated in GWAS with fasting glucose (16 loci) and/or insulin (2 loci) concentrations. For tests of interaction, we considered a P value <0.0028 (0.05 of 18 tests) as statistically significant.\n\nGreater whole-grain food intake was associated with lower fasting glucose and insulin concentrations independent of demographics, other dietary and lifestyle factors, and BMI (\u03b2 [95% CI] per 1-serving-greater whole-grain intake: -0.009 mmol/l glucose [-0.013 to -0.005], P < 0.0001 and -0.011 pmol/l [ln] insulin [-0.015 to -0.007], P = 0.0003).

Sequence data were evaluated for signs of selection potentially related to genomic differentiation in these young sister species, which hybridize despite reduced fitness of hybrids. Seven loci were significantly more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality and they also displayed reduced nucleotide diversity, consistent with having been influenced by directional selection.

Both high BMI and diabetes are vascular risk factors that might play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Thus, our aim was to explore the impact of FTO on AD and dementia risk. Nine years of follow-up data was gathered from the Kungsholmen project, a prospective population-based study on 1,003 persons without dementia. Cox-regression models were used to assess the relative risks of developing AD and dementia (DSM-III-R criteria) according to FTO genotypes (rs9939609), taking into account APOE, physical inactivity, BMI, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Compared to carriers of the FTO TT-genotype, AA-carriers had a higher risk for AD (RR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.24) and for dementia (RR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.09-2.02) after adjustment for age, gender, education, and APOE genotype. This effect remained after additional adjustment for physical inactivity, BMI, diabetes, and CVD. An interaction between FTO and APOE was found, with increased risk for dementia for those carrying both FTO AA and APOE \u03f54. Importantly, the effect of the AA-genotype on dementia/AD risk seems to act mostly through the interaction with APOE \u03f54. Our findings suggest that the FTO AA-genotype increases the risk for dementia, and in particular AD, independently of physical inactivity, BMI, diabetes, and CVD measured at baseline. Our results are in line with the recently reported association between FTO and reduced brain volume in cognitively healthy subjects.", "doi": "10.3233/JAD-2010-101068", "pmid": "21098976", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "K2785TXG42873L62"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a3360f0bfa004bea9ca37b6b64c086dd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a3360f0bfa004bea9ca37b6b64c086dd"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "95602e2c69144b29be43c990a4c55b8d", "title": "SNP detection and prediction of variability between chicken lines using genome resequencing of DNA pools.", "authors": [{"family": "Marklund", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Carlborg", "given": "Orjan", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-11-25", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": null, "pages": "665", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing technologies are widely used for detection of millions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and also provide a means of assessing their variation. This information is useful for composing subsets of highly informative SNPs for region-specific or genome-wide analysis and to identify mutations regulating phenotypic differences within or between populations. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of SNP detection and introduced the flanking SNPs value (FSV) as a novel measure for predicting SNP-variability using ~5X genome resequencing with ABI SOLID and DNA pools from two chicken lines divergently selected for juvenile bodyweight.\n\nGenotyping with a 60 K SNP chip revealed polymorphisms within or between two divergently selected chicken lines for 31 363 SNPs, 48% of which were also detected using resequencing of DNA pools. SNP detection using resequencing was more powerful for positions with larger differences in allele frequency between the lines. About 50% of the SNPs with non-reference allele frequencies in the range 0.5-0.6 and 67% of those with frequencies > 0.9 could be detected. On average, ~3.7 SNPs/kb were detected by resequencing, with about 5% lower density on microchromosomes than on macrochromosomes. There was a positive correlation between the observed between-line SNP variation from the 60 K chip analysis and our proposed FSV score computed from the genome resequencing data. The strongest correlations on macrochromosomes and microchromosomes were observed when the FSV was calculated with total flanking regions of 62 kb (correlation 0.55) and 38 kb (correlation 0.45), respectively.\n\nGenome resequencing with limited coverage (~5X) using pooled DNA samples and three non-reference reads as a threshold for SNP detection, identified 50 - 67% of the 60 K SNPs with a non-reference allele frequency larger than 0.5. The SNP density was around 5% lower on the microchromosomes, most likely because of their higher gene content. Our proposed method to estimate the SNP variation (FSV) uses additional sequence information to better predict SNP informativity. The FSV scores showed higher correlations for SNPs with a larger difference in allele frequency between the populations. The correlation was strongest on macrochromosomes, probably due to a lower recombination rate.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-11-665", "pmid": "21108801", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1471-2164-11-665"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3091782"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/95602e2c69144b29be43c990a4c55b8d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/95602e2c69144b29be43c990a4c55b8d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "329341749ed544ad9028d36d8972f6a4", "title": "Gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation identify DBN1, SETMAR and HIG2 as direct targets of SOX11 in mantle cell lymphoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Wang", "given": "Xiao", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rklund", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wasik", "given": "Agata M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Grandien", "given": "Alf", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kimby", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Dahlman-Wright", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Chunyan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Christensson", "given": "Birger", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Sander", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-11-22", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "11", "pages": "e14085", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "The SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 11 (SOX11) gene, located on chromosome 2p25, encodes for a transcription factor that is involved in tissue remodeling during embryogenesis and is crucial for neurogenesis. The role for SOX11 in hematopoiesis has not yet been defined. Two genes under direct control of SOX11 are the class- III \u03b2-tubulin gene (TUBB3) in neural cells and the transcription factor TEA domain family member 2 (TEAD2) in neural and mesenchymal progenitor cells. Normal, mature lymphocytes lack SOX11 but express SOX4, another member of the same group of SOX transcription factors. We and others recently identified SOX11 as aberrantly expressed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Since SOX11 is variably expressed in MCL it may not be essential for tumorigenesis, but may carry prognostic information. Currently, no specific functional effects have been linked to SOX11 expression in MCL and it is not known which genes are under influence of SOX11 in lymphoma. In this study we found variable expression of SOX11, SOX4 and SOX12 mRNA in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines. Downregulation of SOX11 expression by siRNA verified that SOX11 controlled the expression of the gene TUBB3 in the MCL cell line Granta 519. Furthermore we identified, by global gene expression analysis, 26 new target genes influenced by siRNA SOX11 downmodulation. Among these genes, DBN1, SETMAR and HIG2 were found to be significantly correlated to SOX11 expression in two cohorts of primary mantle cell lymphomas. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that these genes are direct targets of the SOX11 protein. In spite of almost complete downregulation of the SOX11 protein no significant effects on Granta 519 cell proliferation or survival in short term in vitro experiments was found. In summary we have identified a number of genes influenced by SOX11 expression in MCL cell lines and primary MCL. Among these genes, DBN1, SETMAR and HIG2 are direct transcriptional targets of the SOX11 protein.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014085", "pmid": "21124928", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression

A method to extract live meiofauna was developed and used in order to experimentally manipulate meiofauna abundance and group diversity. Higher abundances of meiofauna were found to significantly decrease naphthalene mineralization. Furthermore, a change in the bacterial community composition (studied using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) was also observed in presence of higher meiofauna abundance, as well as a lower number of cultivable naphthalene-degrading bacteria. The reduced mineralization of naphthalene and the altered bacterial community composition in the presence of increased meiofauna abundance is likely the result of top-down control by meiofauna.

We also conducted replication analyses in Japanese of susceptibility loci for hypertension identified recently from genome-wide association studies of European ancestries. Association analysis revealed significant association of the ATP2B1 rs2070759 polymorphism with hypertension (P=5.3\u00d710(-5); allelic odds ratio: 1.17 [95% CI: 1.09 to 1.26]). Additional SNPs in ATP2B1 were subsequently genotyped, and the most significant association was with rs11105378 (odds ratio: 1.31 [95% CI: 1.21 to 1.42]; P=4.1\u00d710(-11)). Association of rs11105378 with hypertension was cross-validated by replication analysis with the Global Blood Pressure Genetics consortium data set (odds ratio: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.05 to 1.21]; P=5.9\u00d710(-4)). Mean adjusted systolic blood pressure was highly significantly associated with the same SNP in a meta-analysis with individuals of European descent (P=1.4\u00d710(-18)). ATP2B1 mRNA expression levels in umbilical artery smooth muscle cells were found to be significantly different among rs11105378 genotypes.

Changes in retinal vascular caliber reflect early microvascular disease and predict incident cardiovascular events. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with retinal vascular caliber. We analyzed data from four population-based discovery cohorts with 15,358 unrelated Caucasian individuals, who are members of the Cohort for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and replicated findings in four independent Caucasian cohorts (n \u200a= \u200a6,652). All participants had retinal photography and retinal arteriolar and venular caliber measured from computer software. In the discovery cohorts, 179 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) spread across five loci were significantly associated (p<5.0\u00d710(-8)) with retinal venular caliber, but none showed association with arteriolar caliber. Collectively, these five loci explain 1.0%-3.2% of the variation in retinal venular caliber. Four out of these five loci were confirmed in independent replication samples. In the combined analyses, the top SNPs at each locus were: rs2287921 (19q13; p\u200a =\u200a 1.61\u00d710(-25), within the RASIP1 locus), rs225717 (6q24; p\u200a=\u200a1.25\u00d710(-16), adjacent to the VTA1 and NMBR loci), rs10774625 (12q24; p \u200a=\u200a 2.15\u00d710(-13), in the region of ATXN2,SH2B3 and PTPN11 loci), and rs17421627 (5q14; p\u200a=\u200a7.32\u00d710(-16), adjacent to the MEF2C locus).

The intracellular functions of the expressed proteins from the breast cancer risk genes PALB2 and BRCA2 are closely related. Therefore, we investigated the relation between genetic variants in PALB2 and BRCA2 and BD. Due to increasing evidence of genetic overlap between BD and schizophrenia (SCZ), we also investigated association with SCZ. In a Scandinavian case-control sample (n\u2009=\u2009686/2,538) we found the BRCA2 SNP rs9567552 to be significantly associated with BD (Nominal P\u2009=\u20090.00043). Additionally, we replicated the association between PALB2 SNP rs420259 and BD (Nominal P\u2009=\u20090.025). We then combined our sample with another Nordic case-control sample (n\u2009=\u2009435/11,491) from Iceland, and added results from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) (n\u2009=\u20091,868/2,938) and the STEP-UCL/ED-DUB-STEP2 study (n\u2009=\u20092,558/3,274) in a meta-analysis which revealed a P-value of 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5) for association between PALB2 SNP rs420259 and BD (n\u2009=\u20095,547/20,241).

Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches. Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration, is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes.

The predominant model for testing APOE involves the haplotype combinations of e2, e3, and e4 and has been basis of associations with dementia, atherosclerosis, and serum lipid levels. Here, we demonstrate the functional independence of these two component sites, with rs7412 contributing to the majority of variance in serum LDL (p=10-20), whereas rs429358 alone influences variance in CSF amyloid-\u00df42 (A\u00df42) (p=10(-17)). This latter relationship is also reflected in the association of APOE with dementia, where rs429358 strongly influences disease (p=10(-67)), but rs7412 does not. Models based upon e2, e3, and e4 explained less variance for both dementia risk and CSF A\u00df42 than did rs429358 alone. When adjusted for CSF A\u00df42, the association of rs429358 with dementia is greatly reduced but remains significant indicating that APOE polymorphism influences disease by additional mechanisms distinct from A\u00df42 metabolism. We reach four principal conclusion from this study: 1) rs429358 alone is responsible for the association of APOE with dementia; 2) The association of APOE with dementia is substantially mediated by its effect on CNS A\u00df42 levels; 3) The association of APOE with dementia is not mediated by its impact on peripheral lipid metabolism; and 4) The dichotomy of effects of rs429358 and rs7412 represents one of the best examples of genetic pleiotropy for complex traits known and illustrates the importance of allelic heterogeneity in APOE.", "doi": "10.3233/JAD-2010-100864", "pmid": "20847432", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "8053337K12207242"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3547982"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS404207"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/02a89d31328a4bc681053d56186048cc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/02a89d31328a4bc681053d56186048cc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "779f19440cf34645bca610a012f6bacc", "title": "Trisomy and triploidy are sources of embryo mortality in the zebra finch.", "authors": [{"family": "Forstmeier", "given": "Wolfgang", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Ellegren", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-09-07", "journal": {"volume": "277", "issn": "1471-2954", "issue": "1694", "pages": "2655-2660", "title": "Proc.

In birds, an average of about 10 per cent of eggs across species fail to hatch, often owing to the death of embryos. While embryo mortality owing to inbreeding is both well-documented and evolutionarily plausible, this is not true for other sources of mortality. In fact, the basis for hatching failure in natural populations remains largely unexplained. Here, we demonstrate that embryo mortality in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) follows from chromosomal aneuploidy or polyploidy. As part of microsatellite genotyping of a captive breeding population, we found 12 individuals (3.6%) with three alleles among 331 embryos that had died during development, while there were no such cases observed among 1210 adult birds. Subsequent genotyping of 1920 single nucleotide polymorphism markers distributed across the genome in birds with three alleles at microsatellite loci, and in greater than 1000 normal birds, revealed that the aberrant karyotypes involved cases of both trisomies and triploidy. Cases of both maternally and paternally inherited trisomies resulted from non-disjunction during meiosis. Maternally inherited cases of triploidy were attributable to failure of meiosis leading to diploid eggs, while paternally inherited triploidy could have arisen either from diploid sperm or from dispermy. Our initial microsatellite screening set only had the power to detect less than 10 per cent of trisomies and by extrapolation, our data therefore tentatively suggest that trisomy might be a major cause of embryo mortality in zebra finches.", "doi": "10.1098/rspb.2010.0394", "pmid": "20444723", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "rspb.2010.0394"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2982043"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/779f19440cf34645bca610a012f6bacc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/779f19440cf34645bca610a012f6bacc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5b63dc3ea73541608890047d4c582417", "title": "Association of IFIH1 and other autoimmunity risk alleles with selective IgA deficiency.", "authors": [{"family": "Ferreira", "given": "Ricardo C", "initials": "RC"}, {"family": "Pan-Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Qiang", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Graham", "given": "Robert R", "initials": "RR"}, {"family": "Gateva", "given": "Vesela", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Font\u00e1n", "given": "Gumersindo", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Annette T", "initials": "AT"}, {"family": "Ortmann", "given": "Ward", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Urcelay", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Arquero", "given": "Miguel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "given": "Concepci\u00f3n", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Jorgensen", "given": "Gudmundur", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ludviksson", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn R", "initials": "BR"}, {"family": "Koskinen", "given": "Sinikka", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Haimila", "given": "Katri", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Clark", "given": "Hilary F", "initials": "HF"}, {"family": "Klareskog", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gregersen", "given": "Peter K", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Behrens", "given": "Timothy W", "initials": "TW"}, {"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-09-00", "journal": {"volume": "42", "issn": "1546-1718", "issue": "9", "pages": "777-780", "title": "Nat.

An extended range of targets such as interacting or post-translationally modified proteins can further improve the potential for diagnostics and patient stratification, and for monitoring response to treatment. These are critical building blocks for personalized treatment strategies to manage disease. The past few decades have seen a remarkably improved understanding of the molecular basis of disease in general, and of tumour formation and progression in particular. This accumulated knowledge creates opportunities to develop drugs that specifically target molecules or molecular complexes critical for survival and expansion of tumour cells. However, tumours are highly variable between patients, necessitating the development of diagnostic tools to individualize treatment through parallel analysis of sets of biomarkers. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) can address many of the requirements for advanced molecular analysis. The method builds on the principle that recognition of target proteins by two, three or more antibodies can bring in proximity DNA strands attached to the antibodies. The DNA strands can then participate in ligation reactions, giving rise to molecules that are amplified for highly sensitive detection. PLA is particularly well suited for sensitive, specific and multiplexed analysis of protein expression, post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions.

Taken together these findings suggest that RBM3 may be a useful prognostic and treatment predictive marker in EOC.", "doi": "10.1186/1479-5876-8-78", "pmid": "20727170", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1479-5876-8-78"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2936876"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/48f20361419045e3bacde5fd8576433b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/48f20361419045e3bacde5fd8576433b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6e72f003dd044238899adec74a9c8680", "title": "Familial cutaneous melanoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Hansson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-08-07", "journal": {"volume": "685", "issn": "0065-2598", "issue": null, "pages": "134-145", "title": "Adv.

Worldwide, approximately 20-40% of kindreds with familial elanoma harbor germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, located on chromosome 9p21, which encodes two different proteins, p16INK4 and p14ARF, both involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and induction of senescence. In different populations several recurring CDKN2A founder mutations have been described. The risk of melanoma in CDKN2A mutations carriers varies between populations and is higher in regions with high sun exposure and high incidence of melanoma in the general population. Some CDKN2A mutations have been associated not only with melanoma but also with increased risk of other malignancies--most notably pancreatic carcinoma. A much smaller number of families have germline mutations in the CDK4 gene on chromosome 12q14, encoding a cyclin dependent kinase which normally interacts with p16INK4A.

We investigated lipid metabolism in Npc1(-/-) mouse hepatocytes and the association of NPC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with circulating TGs in humans. TGs were reduced in Npc1(-/-) mouse serum and hepatocytes. In Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes, the incorporation of [3H]oleic acid and [3H]acetate into TG was decreased, but shunting of oleic acid- or acetate-derived [3H]carbons into cholesterol was increased. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis normalized TG synthesis, content, and secretion in Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes, suggesting increased hepatic cholesterol neogenesis as a cause for the reduced TG content and secretion. We found a significant association between serum TG levels and 5 common NPC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a cohort of 1053 men, with the lowest P=8.7 x 10(-4) for the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1429934.

Validation of the results using FISH on tissue microarrays (TMAs) identified TOP1 as being amplified in melanoma tissues.

Chromosome speciation models propose a role for chromosomal rearrangements in promoting the build up of reproductive isolation between diverging populations and empirical data from several animal and plant taxa support these models. The pied flycatcher and the collared flycatcher are two closely related species that probably evolved reproductive isolation during geographical separation in Pleistocene glaciation refugia. Despite the short divergence time and current hybridization, these two species demonstrate a high degree of intrinsic post-zygotic isolation and previous studies have shown that traits involved in mate choice and hybrid viability map to the Z-chromosome. Could rearrangements of the Z-chromosome between the species explain their reproductive isolation? We developed high coverage Z-chromosome linkage maps for both species, using gene-based markers and large-scale SNP genotyping. Best order maps contained 57-62 gene markers with an estimated average density of one every 1-1.5 Mb. We estimated the recombination rates in flycatcher Z-chromosomes to 1.1-1.3 cM/Mb. A comparison of the maps of the two species revealed extensive co-linearity with no strong evidence for chromosomal rearrangements.

Only two CYP1 genes, CYP1A1 and CYP1A3, are so far known in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The present study aimed to identify other CYP1 subfamily genes in rainbow trout, to establish methods for quantitative mRNA expression analysis of these genes, and to determine their basal and induced mRNA expression in gills and liver. Another goal was to examine their mRNA expression in environmentally exposed fish. We cloned four new transcripts, denoted rbCYP1B1, rbCYP1C1, rbCYP1C2, and rbCYP1C3. Levels of these and the previously known rbCYP1A transcripts were determined by real-time PCR in unexposed fish, fish exposed to the potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), and fish caged in various waters in the Uppsala region (Sweden). The mRNA expression patterns observed in unexposed rainbow trout (basal levels) were markedly similar to those reported for orthologous genes in other species. All six transcripts were induced by PCB126 in gills and liver, suggesting all genes to be AhR regulated. The caged fish showed clear rbCYP1 induction in gills at all monitoring sites (up to 70-fold the basal level), whereas the liver responses were weak; induction (up to 5-fold) was recorded only at the Uppsala municipal sewage treatment plant outlet. Gill filament EROD activity was induced at all caging sites. Most interestingly, the rbCYP1 gene response patterns in gills differed among caging sites and among subfamilies. The EROD induction seemed to only reflect induction of rbCYP1A transcription. Response patterns of multiple CYP1 genes in gills and liver could provide an improved monitoring strategy. Such patterns could be used to characterize complex mixtures of AhR agonists and antagonists in aquatic environments.", "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.03.003", "pmid": "20371123", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0166-445X(10)00088-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2892734"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS194180"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/542df632abda49249bbf5f14dc948721.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/542df632abda49249bbf5f14dc948721"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f12704da529244efaface4deeba2615e", "title": "Different SNP combinations in the GCH1 gene and use of labor analgesia.", "authors": [{"family": "Dabo", "given": "Fatimah", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gr\u00f6nbladh", "given": "Alfhild", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nyberg", "given": "Fred", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m-Poromaa", "given": "Inger", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Akerud", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-07-15", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1744-8069", "issue": null, "pages": "41", "title": "Mol Pain"}, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate if there is an association between different SNP combinations in the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GCH1) gene and a number of pain behavior related outcomes during labor.

Optimized UDPS protocols and bioinformatic software were developed to generate, clean and analyze the data. The data cleaning strategy reduced the error rate of UDPS to an average of 0.05%, which is lower than previously reported. Consequently, the cut-off for detection of resistance mutations was very low. A median of 16,016 (range 2,406-35,401) sequence reads were obtained per sample, which allowed detection and quantification of minority resistance mutations at amino acid position 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215 and 219 in RT. In four of five pre-treatment samples low levels (0.07-0.09%) of the M184I mutation were observed. Other resistance mutations, except T215A and T215I were below the detection limit. During treatment failure, M184V replaced M184I and dominated the population in combination with T215Y, while wild-type variants were rarely detected. Resistant virus disappeared rapidly after treatment interruption and was undetectable as early as after 3 months. In most patients, drug resistant variants were replaced by wild-type variants identical to those present before treatment, suggesting rebound from latent reservoirs.\n\nWith this highly sensitive UDPS protocol preexisting drug resistance was infrequently observed; only M184I, T215A and T215I were detected at very low levels.

Here, we present a time-series global transcription profile for autosomal genes in male and female chicken, beginning with embryonic development and spanning to reproductive maturity, for the gonad. Overall, the amount and magnitude of sex-biased expression increased as a function of age, though sex-biased gene expression was surprisingly ephemeral, with very few genes exhibiting continuous sex bias in both embryonic and adult tissues. Despite a large predicted role of the sex chromosomes in sexual dimorphism, our study indicates that the autosomes house the majority of genes with sex-biased expression. Most interestingly, sex-specific evolutionary pressures shifted over the course of the life cycle, acting equally strongly on female-biased genes and male-biased genes but at different ages. Female-biased genes exhibited high rates of divergence late in embryonic development, shortly before arrested meiosis halts oogenesis. The level of divergence on female-biased late embryonic genes is similar to that seen in male-biased genes expressed in adult gonads, which correlates with the onset of spermatogenesis.

Genes containing ERbeta-binding sites can be regulated by E2. Notably, approximately 60% of the genomic regions bound by ERbeta contained AP-1-like binding regions and estrogen response element-like sites, suggesting a functional association between AP-1 and ERbeta signaling.

Using a re-ChIP assay, we showed co-occupancy of ERbeta and AP-1 on chromatin. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of c-Fos or c-Jun expression decreased ERbeta recruitment to chromatin, consistent with the role of AP-1 in mediating estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.

Here we report on 2 patients with interstitial deletions at 6q14.1-q15 presenting with obesity and symptoms strikingly similar to those reported for deletions involving the SIM1 gene despite not having a deletion of this gene. METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridisation was used to diagnose 2 children with obesity and developmental delay, revealing 2 interstitial deletions at 6q14.1-q15 of 8.73 and 4.50 Mb, respectively, and a region of overlap of 4.2-Mb. RESULTS: The similar phenotype in the 2 patients was most likely due to a 4.2-Mb common microdeletion at 6q14.1-q15. Another patient has previously been described with an overlapping deletion. The 3 patients share several features, such as developmental delay, obesity, hernia, rounded face with full cheeks, epicanthal folds, short palpebral fissures, bulbous nose, large ears, and syndactyly between toes II and III.

We describe here a high-throughput method for analyzing transcription factor binding specificity that is based on systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and massively parallel sequencing. The method is optimized for analysis of large numbers of TFs in parallel through the use of affinity-tagged proteins, barcoded selection oligonucleotides, and multiplexed sequencing. Data are analyzed by a new bioinformatic platform that uses the hundreds of thousands of sequencing reads obtained to control the quality of the experiments and to generate binding motifs for the TFs. The described technology allows higher throughput and identification of much longer binding profiles than current microarray-based methods. In addition, as our method is based on proteins expressed in mammalian cells, it can also be used to characterize DNA-binding preferences of full-length proteins or proteins requiring post-translational modifications. We validate the method by determining binding specificities of 14 different classes of TFs and by confirming the specificities for NFATC1 and RFX3 using ChIP-seq.

The proteins were analyzed immunohistochemically on a specially designed tissue microarray, containing isolated human islets and pancreatic tissues with different characteristics, and compared to the expression of previously known markers of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells. Of the five novel endocrine markers, tetraspanin-7 was identified as a membrane-bound protein with exclusive positivity in islet cells.

The potential exocrine marker galectin-2 was expressed in both exocrine acinary cells and pancreatic ductal cells, with no or low positivity in islet cells.

We aimed to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their role in regulation of glucose control, insulin secretion and/or action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084). RESULTS The glucose-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels, but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)). Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in glucose-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and C2CD4B. Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in glucose-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin or insulin sensitivity). Two loci previously associated with fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS Genetic loci identified through their effect on hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed physiological characterization of such loci for improved understanding of pathways associated with alterations in glucose homeostasis and eventually type 2 diabetes.", "doi": "10.2337/db09-1568", "pmid": "20185807", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "db09-1568"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2857908"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4896fad053ba487492e6c05d927705fa.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4896fad053ba487492e6c05d927705fa"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4c9618beb27b4bb089b1fd3545d1736b", "title": "The impact of RNA standardization and heterogeneous gene expression on the results of cDNA array of human breast carcinoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Khoshnoud", "given": "Reza", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "He", "given": "Qimin", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Sylv\u00e1n", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Khoshnoud", "given": "Aida", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ivarsson", "given": "Madleen", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Fornander", "given": "Tommy", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bergh", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Frisell", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rutqvist", "given": "Lars-Erik", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Skog", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "25", "issn": "1791-244X", "issue": "5", "pages": "735-741", "title": "Int.

In this study, we examined how standardization of gene expression to total mg RNA or mg tissue and tumor heterogeneity affect the final results. We found that the gene expression of human breast tumors was approximately 9 times higher in malignant tissue as compared to the non-malignant tissue when expressed per total mg RNA, but approximately 40 times higher when expressed per mg tissue. Genes that were expected to act as housekeeping genes (PUC18, RPL and beta-actin) varied between different parts of the tumor and also between non-malignant and malignant tissues, excluding them as reference genes. We also found that the gene expression differed in various parts of the breast tumor, probably due to a mixture of different types of cells, i.e. non-malignant and malignant cells. To find out if the variations in the gene expression were due to cell heterogeneity we used microdissection to collect malignant cells separately. We found that the gene expression was markedly different in the isolated malignant cells as compared to the gene expression of the bulk tumor tissue. Thus, to be able to evaluate results from cDNA array gene expression experiments it is, to our opinion, necessary to work with pure tumor cell populations, until solid information is available on the impact of stromal component. Housekeeping genes should be handling with care and mg tissue may be preferred instead of microg RNA for standardization.", "doi": "10.3892/ijmm_00000399", "pmid": "20372817", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4c9618beb27b4bb089b1fd3545d1736b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4c9618beb27b4bb089b1fd3545d1736b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "502a7a8e7d64496aa6c1aac673caa148", "title": "Mapping of the fibroblast growth factors in human white adipose tissue.", "authors": [{"family": "Mejhert", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Galitzky", "given": "Jean", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Amanda T", "initials": "AT"}, {"family": "Bambace", "given": "Clara", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Blomqvist", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bouloumi\u00e9", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Frayn", "given": "Keith N", "initials": "KN"}, {"family": "Dahlman", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Arner", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ryd\u00e9n", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "95", "issn": "1945-7197", "issue": "5", "pages": "2451-2457", "title": "J.

Furthermore, FGF1 was not secreted into the circulation. Although FGF1 levels were 2-fold increased in obesity, they were unaltered by weight reduction. Only FGF1 and FGF2 induced a marked concentration-dependent phosphorylation of p44/42 in cultured human adipocytes.\n\nOf the investigated FGFs, only FGF1 is secreted from sc WAT and predominantly so from the adipocyte fraction. The activity in adipocyte cultures and lack of secretion into the circulation suggest that FGF1 acts as an auto- or paracrine factor.

This occurred by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-8 and antarafacial dioxygenation at C-8 or at C-10 with double bond migration. 8R-HPODE was then isomerized to 5S,8R-DiHODE and to 8R,11S-DiHODE by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogens at C-5 and C-11 of 8R-HPODE, respectively, followed by suprafacial oxygenation. The genome of A. clavatus codes for two enzymes, which can be aligned with >65% amino acid identity to 10R-DOX and 5,8-LDS, respectively. The 5,8-LDS homologue likely forms and isomerizes 8R-HPODE to 5S,8R-DiHODE. A third gene (ppoB) codes for a protein which carries a serine residue at the cysteine position of the P450 motif. This Cys to Ser replacement is known to abolish P450 2B4 catalysis and the hydroperoxide isomerase activity of 5,8-LDS, suggesting that ppoB of A. clavatus may not be involved in the biosynthesis of 8R,11S-DiHODE.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbalip.2009.12.012", "pmid": "20045744", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1388-1981(09)00292-3"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9ef62eced5e1409b90aec4ff52553390.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9ef62eced5e1409b90aec4ff52553390"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b415728393504e02b54392dedbf91a1e", "title": "Increased serum progesterone and estradiol correlate to increased COX-2 tissue expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.", "authors": [{"family": "Samir", "given": "Raghad", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tot", "given": "Tibor", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Asplund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pekar", "given": "Gyula", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Hellberg", "given": "Dan", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "30", "issn": "1791-7530", "issue": "4", "pages": "1217-1222", "title": "Anticancer Res."}, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to To investigate correlations between serum progesterone and serum estradiol levels and expression of tissue tumor markers in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and normal epithelium.\n\nEighty women of fertile ages with cervical biopsies ranging histologically from normal to CIN III were included.

In so doing, this allowed the identification of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements distinguishing them. The previously reported interchromosomal conservation of synteny was confirmed, but a larger than expected number of intrachromosomal rearrangements were reported; (2) to hybridize zebra finch genomic DNA to a chicken tiling path microarray and identify CNVs in the zebra finch genome relative to chicken; 32 interspecific CNVs were identified; and (3) to test the hypothesis that there is an association between CNV, chromosomal rearrangements, and recombination by correlating data from (1) and (2) with recombination rate data from a high-resolution genetic linkage map of the zebra finch.

The tendency of Gcn5 to re-localise to the transcribed regions of long genes during KCl stress adaptation suggests that Gcn5 plays a specific role in the expression of long genes under adaptive conditions, perhaps by regulating transcriptional elongation as has been seen for Gcn5 in S. pombe.

They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor. We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates.

Although the diversity of the microbiota subsequently recovered to resemble the pre treatment states, the microbiota remained perturbed in some cases for up to four years post treatment.

The majority of the mutations are predicted to cause an up-regulation of the pathway; hence they are gain-of-function mutations. Despite recent advances in gene identification in NS, the genetic aetiology is still unknown in about 1/4 of patients. To investigate the contribution of gene dosage imbalances of RAS-MAPK-related genes to the pathogenesis of NS, a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was developed. Two probe sets were designed for seven RAS-MAPK-syndrome-related candidate genes: PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2. The probe sets were validated in 15 healthy control individuals and in glioma tumour cell lines. Subsequently, 44 NS patients negative for mutations in known NS-associated genes were screened using the two probe sets. The MLPA results for the patients revealed no gene dosage imbalances. In conclusion, the present results exclude copy number variation of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 as a common pathogenic mechanism of NS.

Three SNPs spanning intron 6 and 7, including the A218C and A779C polymorphisms, were associated with schizophrenia susceptibility (P = 0.019). However there were no differences in allele frequencies of these loci between affected individuals having attempted suicide at least once and patients with no history of suicide attempts (P = 0.84). A systematic literature review and meta-analysis support the A218C polymorphism as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.29). Association studies on suicide attempts are however conflicting (heterogeneity index I(2) = 0.54) and do not support the A218C/A779C polymorphisms being a susceptibility locus for suicidal behavior among individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (OR = 0.96 [0.80-1.16]).

As for TBI, cell clusters of 150-200 mum expressing Cxcl10 characterize the cerebral cortex of mice carrying a transgene encoding the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein, a model of amyloid Alzheimer pathology. The same pattern was found in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice modelling multiple sclerosis. In contrast, mice carrying a SOD1(G93A) mutant mimicking amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology lacked such cell clusters in the cerebral cortex, whereas clusters appeared in the brainstem and spinal cord. Mice homozygous for a null mutation of the Cxcl10 gene did not show detectable levels of Cxcl10 transcript after TBI, confirming the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in-situ hybridization signals. Moreover, unbiased microarray expression analysis showed that Cxcl10 was among 112 transcripts in the neocortex upregulated at least threefold in both TBI and ageing TgSwe mice, many of them involved in inflammation. The identity of the Cxcl10(+) cells remains unclear but flow cytometry showed increased numbers of activated microglia/macrophages as well as myeloid dendritic cells in the TBI and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models.

The aim of this study was to investigate how different fixatives influence protein recognition by immunodetection methods in tissues, cell preparations, and protein lysates, as compared with formalin. Seventy-two affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were used to evaluate seven different fixatives. The aldehyde-based fixative Glyo-fixx proved to be excellent for preservation of proteins in tissue detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), similar to formalin. A non-aldehyde-based fixative, NEO-FIX was superior for fixation of cultured cells, in regard to morphology, and thereby also advantageous for IHC. Large variability in the amount of protein extracted from the differently fixed tissues was observed, and the HOPE fixative provided the overall highest yield of protein. In conclusion, morphological resolution and immunoreactivity were superior in tissues fixed with aldehyde-based fixatives, whereas the use of non-aldehyde-based fixatives can be advantageous in obtaining high protein yield for Western blot analysis.

The interest of using willow for biomass production is growing, which has resulted in increased pressure on breeding of high yielding and resistant clones adapted to different environments. The main purpose of this work was to develop dense genetic linkage maps for mapping of traits related to yield and resistance in willow. We used the Populus trichocarpa genome to extract evenly spaced markers and mapped the orthologous loci in the willow genome. The marker positions in the two genomes were used to study genome evolution since the divergence of the two lineages some 45 mya.\n\nWe constructed two linkage maps covering the 19 linkage groups in willow. The most detailed consensus map, S1, contains 495 markers with a total genetic distance of 2477 cM and an average distance of 5.0 cM between the markers. The S3 consensus map contains 221 markers and has a total genetic distance of 1793 cM and an average distance of 8.1 cM between the markers. We found high degree of synteny and gene order conservation between willow and poplar. There is however evidence for two major interchromosomal rearrangements involving poplar LG I and XVI and willow LG Ib, suggesting a fission or a fusion in one of the lineages, as well as five intrachromosomal inversions.

Thus, we demonstrate a SUMOylation-mediated mechanism of IGF-1R signaling that has potential implications for gene regulation.", "doi": "10.1126/scisignal.2000628", "pmid": "20145208", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "3/108/ra10"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a8606ec944474ea6978ada299d0a0417.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a8606ec944474ea6978ada299d0a0417"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "15ef40b017654d21a684bf04354b27db", "title": "Coexisting NRAS and BRAF mutations in primary familial melanomas with specific CDKN2A germline alterations.", "authors": [{"family": "Jovanovic", "given": "Braslav", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Egyhazi", "given": "Suzanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Eskandarpour", "given": "Malihe", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ghiorzo", "given": "Paola", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Palmer", "given": "Jane M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Bianchi Scarr\u00e0", "given": "Giovanna", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Hayward", "given": "Nicholas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2010-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "130", "issn": "1523-1747", "issue": "2", "pages": "618-620", "title": "J.

Despite these prospects and a plethora of candidate biomarkers, efforts in recent years to establish new protein diagnostic assays have met with limited success. One important limiting factor has been the challenge of detecting proteins present at trace levels in complex bodily fluids. To achieve robust, sensitive, and specific detection, we have developed a microparticle-based solid-phase proximity ligation assay, dependent on simultaneous recognition of target proteins by three antibody molecules for added specificity. After capture on a microparticle, solid-phase pairs of proximity probes are added followed by washes, enabling detection and identification of rare protein molecules in blood while consuming small amounts of sample. We demonstrate that single polyclonal antibody preparations raised against target proteins of interest can be readily used to establish assays where detection depends on target recognition by three individual antibody molecules, recognizing separate epitopes. The assay was compared with state-of-the-art sandwich ELISAs for detection of vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8 and interleukin-6, and it was found to be superior both with regard to dynamic range and minimal numbers of molecules detected. Furthermore, the assays exhibited excellent performance in undiluted plasma and serum as well as in whole blood, producing comparable results for nine different antigens. We thus show that solid-phase proximity ligation assay is suitable for validation of a variety of protein biomarkers over broad dynamic ranges in clinical samples.", "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M900248-MCP200", "pmid": "19955079", "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M900248-MCP200"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC2830843"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ce366571c2d45828cf045d514322f38.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ce366571c2d45828cf045d514322f38"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "360d1f119ecc432284c62bf9a350c785", "title": "Genetic variants and disease-associated factors contribute to enhanced interferon regulatory factor 5 expression in blood cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.", "authors": [{"family": "Feng", "given": "Di", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Stone", "given": "Rivka C", "initials": "RC"}, {"family": "Eloranta", "given": "Maija-Leena", "initials": "ML"}, {"family": "Sangster-Guity", "given": "Niquiche", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nordmark", "given": "Gunnel", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sigurdsson", "given": "Snaevar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Chuan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Alm", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Syv\u00e4nen", "given": "Ann-Christine", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnblom", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Barnes", "given": "Betsy J", "initials": "BJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "62", "issn": "0004-3591", "issue": "2", "pages": "562-573", "title": "Arthritis Rheum."}, "abstract": "Genetic variants of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 5 gene (IRF5) are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

After spinal injury there is an initial phase of hyporeflexia followed by hyperreflexia, often referred to as spasticity. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the reappearance of endogenous plateau potentials in motor neurons and the development of spasticity after spinalization. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased excitability of motor neurons and the return of plateau potentials below a spinal cord injury we investigated changes in gene expression in this cell population. We adopted a rat tail-spasticity model with a caudal spinal transection that causes a progressive development of spasticity from its onset after 2 to 3 wk until 2 mo postinjury. Gene expression changes of fluorescently identified tail motor neurons were studied 21 and 60 days postinjury. The motor neurons undergo substantial transcriptional regulation in response to injury. The patterns of differential expression show similarities at both time points, although there are 20% more differentially expressed genes 60 days compared with 21 days postinjury. The study identifies targets of regulation relating to both ion channels and receptors implicated in the endogenous expression of plateaux. The regulation of excitatory and inhibitory signal transduction indicates a shift in the balance toward increased excitability, where the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex together with cholinergic system is up-regulated and the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor system is down-regulated. The genes of the pore-forming proteins Cav1.3 and Nav1.6 were not up-regulated, whereas genes of proteins such as nonpore-forming subunits and intracellular pathways known to modulate receptor and channel trafficking, kinetics, and conductivity showed marked regulation. On the basis of the identified changes in global gene expression in motor neurons, the present investigation opens up for new potential targets for treatment of motor dysfunction following spinal cord injury.", "doi": "10.1152/jn.00609.2009", "pmid": "19939961", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "00609.2009"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3f8aa16f05694fb8acaff1255796495c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3f8aa16f05694fb8acaff1255796495c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "44a038e26eb24be997b53892bb9dd3ba", "title": "Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome-wide nucleosome mapping reveals positioning mechanisms distinct from those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "authors": [{"family": "Lantermann", "given": "Alexandra B", "initials": "AB"}, {"family": "Straub", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lfors", "given": "Annelie", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Yuan", "given": "Guo-Cheng", "initials": "GC"}, {"family": "Ekwall", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Korber", "given": "Philipp", "initials": "P"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2010-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "17", "issn": "1545-9985", "issue": "2", "pages": "251-257", "title": "Nat.

DNA sequence guides nucleosome positioning differently: for example, poly(dA-dT) elements are not enriched in S. pombe nucleosome-depleted regions. Regular nucleosomal arrays emanate more asymmetrically-mainly codirectionally with transcription-from promoter nucleosome-depleted regions, but promoters harboring the histone variant H2A.Z also show regular arrays upstream of these regions. Regular nucleosome phasing in S. pombe has a very short repeat length of 154 base pairs and requires a remodeler, Mit1, that is conserved in humans but is not found in S. cerevisiae.

To investigate the influence of sample preparation on such discovery attempts, we report on a systematic effort to compare serum and plasma protein profiles determined with an antibody suspension bead array. The intensity levels were used to define protein profiles and no significant differences between serum and plasma were observed for 79% of the 174 antibodies (targeting 156 proteins). By excluding 36 antibodies giving rise to differential intensity levels, cluster analysis revealed donor-specific rather than preparation-dependent grouping. With a cohort from a clinically relevant medical condition, the metabolic syndrome, the influence of the sample type on a multiplexed biomarker discovery approach was further investigated. Independent comparisons of protein profiles in serum and plasma revealed an antibody targeting ADAMTSL-4, a protein that would qualify to be studied further in association with the condition. In general, the preparation type had an impact on the results of the applied antibody suspension bead array, and while the technical variability was equal, plasma offered a greater biological variability and allowed to give rise to more discoveries than serum.", "doi": "10.1002/pmic.200900657", "pmid": "19953555", "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/948787308e4448c8b8ce4ef0438881e2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/948787308e4448c8b8ce4ef0438881e2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9ff3b98dad3642b68fabcabed6994ec4", "title": "Sequence variation in SORL1 and dementia risk in Swedes.", "authors": [{"family": "Reynolds", "given": "Chandra A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Hong", "given": "Mun-Gwan", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Ulrika K", "initials": "UK"}, {"family": "Blennow", "given": "Kaj", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Boo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Berg", "given": "Stig", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gatz", "given": "Margaret", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Nancy L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Bennet", "given": "Anna M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Prince", "given": "Jonathan A", "initials": "JA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1364-6753", "issue": "1", "pages": "139-142", "title": "Neurogenetics"}, "abstract": "The gene encoding the neuronal sortilin-related receptor SORL1 has been claimed to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by independent groups and across various human populations. We evaluated six genetic markers in SORL1 in a sample of 1,558 Swedish dementia cases (including 1,270 AD cases) and 2,179 controls. For both single-marker-based and haplotype-based analyses, we found no strong support for SORL1 as a dementia or AD risk-modifying gene in our sample in isolation nor did we observe association with AD/dementia-related traits, including cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid(1-42), tau levels, or age at onset. However, meta-analyses of markers in this study together with previously published studies on SORL1 encompassing in excess of 13,000 individuals does suggest significant association with AD (best odds ratio = 1.097; 95% confidence interval = 1.038-1.158, p = 0.001). All six markers were significant in meta-analyses and it is notable that they occur in two distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks.

We addressed this issue by examining the direct effects of a Gram-positive pathogen, Streptococcus equi, on bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs). Ultrastructural analysis revealed extensive formation of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in response to bacterial infection, indicating strong induction of protein synthesis. However, the BMMCs did not show signs of extensive degranulation, and this was supported by only slow release of histamine in response to infection. Coculture of live bacteria with BMMCs caused a profound secretion of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL7/MCP-3, CXCL2/MIP-2, CCL5/RANTES, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as shown by antibody-based cytokine/chemokine arrays and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In contrast, heat-inactivated bacteria caused only minimal cytokine/chemokine release. The cytokine/chemokine responses were substantially attenuated in Toll-like receptor 2-deficient BMMCs and were strongly dependent on cell-cell contacts between bacteria and BMMCs. Gene chip microarray analysis confirmed a massively upregulated expression of the genes coding for the secreted cytokines and chemokines and also identified a pronounced upregulation of numerous additional genes, including transcription factors, signaling molecules, and proteases.

We investigated if there is an increased susceptibility to AD, which can be attributed to genetic variation in the hPreP gene PITRM1 and if the proteolytic efficiency of recombinant hPreP variants is affected. When a total of 673 AD cases and 649 controls were genotyped for 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), no genetic association between any of the SNPs and the risk for AD was found. In contrast, functional analysis of four non-synonymous SNPs in hPreP revealed a decreased activity compared to wild type hPreP. Using A beta, the presequence of ATP synthase F(1)beta subunit and a fluorescent peptide as substrates, the lowest activity was observed for the hPreP(A525D) variant, corresponding to rs1224893, which displayed only 20-30% of wild type activity.

Known RNA edited substrates suggest, however, that site selective A-to-I editing is particularly important for normal brain development in mammals.\n\nWe have compiled a screen that enables the identification of new sites of site-selective editing, primarily in coding sequences. To avoid hyper-edited repeat regions, we applied our screen to the alu-free mouse genome. Focusing on the mouse also facilitated better experimental verification. To identify candidate sites of RNA editing, we first performed an explorative screen based on RNA structure and genomic sequence conservation. We further evaluated the results of the explorative screen by determining which transcripts were enriched for A-G mismatches between the genomic template and the expressed sequence since the editing product, inosine (I), is read as guanosine (G) by the translational machinery. For expressed sequences, we only considered coding regions to focus entirely on re-coding events. Lastly, we refined the results from the explorative screen using a novel scoring scheme based on characteristics for known A-to-I edited sites. The extent of editing in the final candidate genes was verified using total RNA from mouse brain and 454 sequencing.\n\nUsing this method, we identified and confirmed efficient editing at one site in the Gabra3 gene.

In patient tumour samples, benomyl tended to be more active in haematological compared with solid tumour malignancies, whereas the opposite was observed for carbendazim. In conclusion, benomyl and carbendazim show interesting and diverse cytotoxic mechanisms of action and seem suitable as lead compounds for the development of new anticancer drugs.", "doi": "10.1097/CAD.0b013e328330e74e", "pmid": "19786863", "labels": {"Array and Analysis Facility": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6390ec72923c41d59b4190f3dbf9493e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6390ec72923c41d59b4190f3dbf9493e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a2013b85a285454c98f75e9807d53905", "title": "Modeling of environmental effects in genome-wide association studies identifies SLC2A2 and HP as novel loci influencing serum cholesterol levels.", "authors": [{"family": "Igl", "given": "Wilmar", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Asa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wilson", "given": "James F", "initials": "JF"}, {"family": "Wild", "given": "Sarah H", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Polasek", "given": "Ozren", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Hayward", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Vitart", "given": "Veronique", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Hastie", "given": "Nicholas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Rudan", "given": "Pavao", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Gnewuch", "given": "Carsten", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Schmitz", "given": "Gerd", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Meitinger", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Pramstaller", "given": "Peter P", "initials": "PP"}, {"family": "Hicks", "given": "Andrew A", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Oostra", "given": "Ben A", "initials": "BA"}, {"family": "van Duijn", "given": "Cornelia M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Rudan", "given": "Igor", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Wright", "given": "Alan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Campbell", "given": "Harry", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gyllensten", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "EUROSPAN Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2010-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "1", "pages": "e1000798", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 38 larger genetic regions affecting classical blood lipid levels without adjusting for important environmental influences. We modeled diet and physical activity in a GWAS in order to identify novel loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The Swedish (SE) EUROSPAN cohort (N(SE) = 656) was screened for candidate genes and the non-Swedish (NS) EUROSPAN cohorts (N(NS) = 3,282) were used for replication. In total, 3 SNPs were associated in the Swedish sample and were replicated in the non-Swedish cohorts. While SNP rs1532624 was a replication of the previously published association between CETP and HDL cholesterol, the other two were novel findings. For the latter SNPs, the p-value for association was substantially improved by inclusion of environmental covariates: SNP rs5400 (p(SE,unadjusted) = 3.6 x 10(-5), p(SE,adjusted) = 2.2 x 10(-6), p(NS,unadjusted) = 0.047) in the SLC2A2 (Glucose transporter type 2) and rs2000999 (p(SE,unadjusted) = 1.1 x 10(-3), p(SE,adjusted) = 3.8 x 10(-4), p(NS,unadjusted) = 0.035) in the HP gene (Haptoglobin-related protein precursor).

In this study, the analysis of tissue speci fi c protein expression was performed based on tissue micro array data available on the public Human Protein Atlas database (www.proteinatlas.org). An analysis of human proteins, corresponding to approximately one third of the protein-encoding genes, was carried out in 65 human tissues and cell types. The spatial distribution and relative abundance of 6,678 human proteins, were analyzed in different cell populations from various organs and tissues in the human body using unsupervised methods, such as hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, as well as with supervised methods (Breiman, 2001). Well-known markers, such as neuromodulin for the central nervous system, keratin 20 for gastrointestinal tract and CD45 for hematopoietic cells, were identi fi ed as tissue-speci fi c. Proteins expressed in a tissue-speci fi c manner were identi fi ed for cells in all of the investigated tissues, including the central nervous system, hematopoietic system, squamous epithelium, mesenchymal cells and cells from the gastrointestinal tract. Several proteins not yet associated with tissue-speci fi city were identi fi ed, providing starting points for further studies to explore tissue-speci fi c functions. This includes proteins with no known function, such as ZNF509 expressed in CNS and C1orf201 expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract. In general, the majority of the gene products are expressed in a ubiquitous manner and few proteins are detected exclusively in cells from a particular tissue class, as exempli fi ed by less than 1% of the analyzed proteins found only in the brain.", "doi": "10.4172/jpb.1000153", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9e8e6184e92141b8947d4bd5b6f3c8df.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9e8e6184e92141b8947d4bd5b6f3c8df"}}}]}
