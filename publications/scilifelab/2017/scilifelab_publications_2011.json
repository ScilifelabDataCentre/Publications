This study aims to evaluate physiological parameters and the gene expression profiles of masticatory and limb muscles exposed to factors suggested to trigger AQM, such as mechanical ventilation, immobilization, neuromuscular blocking agents, corticosteroids (CS), and sepsis for 5 days by using a unique porcine model mimicking the ICU conditions. Single muscle fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity, i.e., maximum force normalized to fiber cross-sectional area (specific force), revealed maintained masseter single muscle fiber cross-sectional area and specific-force after 5 days' exposure to all triggering factors. This is in sharp contrast to observations in limb and trunk muscles, showing a dramatic decline in specific force in response to 5 days' exposure to the triggering factors. Significant differences in gene expression were observed between craniofacial and limb muscles, indicating a highly complex and muscle-specific response involving transcription and growth factors, heat shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, oxidative stress responsive elements, and sarcomeric proteins underlying the relative sparing of cranial vs. spinal nerve innervated muscles during exposure to the ICU intervention.", "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00116.2011", "pmid": "22010006", "labels": {"Array and Analysis Facility": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "physiolgenomics.00116.2011"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fcddedebd2f947529567e84610e7b9bf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fcddedebd2f947529567e84610e7b9bf"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1f50059e02074a5e873a48572d7e242e", "title": "Association between body mass index and insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS-4) gene polymorphisms in patients with schizophrenia.", "authors": [{"family": "Melkersson", "given": "Kristina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-12-15", "journal": {"volume": "32", "issn": "0172-780X", "issue": "5", "pages": "634-640", "title": "Neuro Endocrinol.

Alterations in glycosylation processing are associated with numerous diseases and glycans are attracting increasing attention both as disease biomarkers and as targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Using a recently developed high-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis method, we have reported, in a pilot genome-wide association study of 13 glycan features in 2705 individuals from three European populations, that polymorphisms at three loci (FUT8, FUT6/FUT3 and HNF1A) affect plasma levels of N-glycans. Here, we extended the analysis to 33 directly measured and 13 derived glycosylation traits in 3533 individuals and identified three novel gene association (MGAT5, B3GAT1 and SLC9A9) as well as replicated the previous findings using an additional European cohort. MGAT5 (meta-analysis association P-value = 1.80 \u00d7 10(-10) for rs1257220) encodes a glycosyltransferase which is known to synthesize the associated glycans.

Given the glucuronyl transferase activity of B3GAT1, we were able to show that glucuronic acid is present on antennae of plasma glycoproteins underlying the corresponding HPLC peak.

To test whether the S. pombe nuclear periphery behaves similarly, we used DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) to map the target loci of two inner nuclear membrane proteins, Ima1 and Man1. We found that peripheral chromatin shows low levels of RNA-Polymerase II and nucleosome occupancy, both characteristic of repressed chromatin regions. Consistently, lowly expressed genes preferentially associate with the periphery and highly expressed genes are depleted from it. When looking at peripheral intergenic regions (IGRs), we found that divergent IGRs are enriched compared with convergent IGRs, indicating that transcription preferentially points away from the periphery rather than toward it. Interestingly, we found that Ima1 and Man1 have common, but also separate target regions in the genome. Ima1-interacting loci were enriched for the RNAi components Dcr1 and Rdp1. This agrees with previous findings that Dcr1 is localized at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, Man1 target loci were bound by the heterochromatin protein Swi6, especially at subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric chromatin was shown to form a unique chromatin type lacking both repressive and active chromatin features and containing low levels of the histone variant H2A.Z. Thus, we find that the fission yeast nuclear periphery shows similar properties to those of metazoan cells, despite the absence of a nuclear lamina.

We identified and replicated a SNP at LSP1/TNNT3, a SNP at MTHFR-NPPB independent (r(2) = 0.33) of previous reports, and replicated SNPs at AGT and ATP2B1 reported previously. An analysis of combined discovery and follow-up data identified SNPs significantly associated with BP at p < 8.56\u00a0\u00d7 10(-7) at four further loci (NPR3, HFE, NOS3, and SOX6). The high number of discoveries made with modest genotyping effort can be attributed to using a large-scale yet targeted genotyping array and to the development of a weighting scheme that maximized power when meta-analyzing results from samples ascertained with extreme phenotypes, in combination with results from nonascertained or population samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcript expression data highlight potential gene regulatory mechanisms at the MTHFR and NOS3 loci. These results provide candidates for further study to help dissect mechanisms affecting BP and highlight the utility of studying SNPs and samples that are independent of those studied previously even when the sample size is smaller than that in previous studies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.10.013", "pmid": "22100073", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs":

We hypothesized that polymorphisms that alter the expression and/or function of BRCA1 carried on the wild-type (non-mutated) copy of the BRCA1 gene would modify the risk of breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 mutations. A total of 9874 BRCA1 mutation carriers were available in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) for haplotype analyses of BRCA1. Women carrying the rare allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs16942 on the wild-type copy of BRCA1 were at decreased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.95, P = 0.003). Promoter in vitro assays of the major BRCA1 haplotypes showed that common polymorphisms in the regulatory region alter its activity and that this effect may be attributed to the differential binding affinity of nuclear proteins.

Treatment of nerve agent poisoning involves use of antidotes, small molecules capable of reactivating AChE. We have screened a collection of organic molecules to assess their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of AChE, aiming to find lead compounds for further optimization leading to drugs with increased efficacy and/or decreased side effects. 124 inhibitors were discovered, with considerable chemical diversity regarding size, polarity, flexibility and charge distribution. An extensive structure determination campaign resulted in a set of crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. Overall, the ligands have substantial interactions with the peripheral anionic site of AChE, and the majority form additional interactions with the catalytic site (CAS). Reproduction of the bioactive conformation of six of the ligands using molecular docking simulations required modification of the default parameter settings of the docking software. The results show that docking-assisted structure-based design of AChE inhibitors is challenging and requires crystallographic support to obtain reliable results, at least with currently available software. The complex formed between C5685 and Mus musculus AChE (C5685\u2022mAChE) is a representative structure for the general binding mode of the determined structures. The CAS binding part of C5685 could not be structurally determined due to a disordered electron density map and the developed docking protocol was used to predict the binding modes of this part of the molecule. We believe that chemical modifications of our discovered inhibitors, biochemical and biophysical characterization, crystallography and computational chemistry provide a route to novel AChE inhibitors and reactivators.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0026039", "pmid": "22140425", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-11-11581"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3227566"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b40b6662466c42fba773726d8fbdacee.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b40b6662466c42fba773726d8fbdacee"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d11a70e0354c482ba76ccd807a782ea5", "title": "Next-generation sequencing technologies and applications for human genetic history and forensics.", "authors": [{"family": "Berglund", "given": "Eva C", "initials": "EC"}, {"family": "Kiialainen", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Syv\u00e4nen", "given": "Ann-Christine", "initials": "AC"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-11-24", "journal": {"volume": "2", "issn": "2041-2223", "issue": null, "pages": "23", "title": "Investig Genet"}, "abstract": "Rapid advances in the development of sequencing technologies in recent years have enabled an increasing number of applications in biology and medicine.

Genomic analysis of several strains has revealed an extensive H. pylori pan-genome, likely to grow as more genomes are sampled. Here we describe the draft genome sequence (63 contigs; 26\u00d7 mean coverage) of H. pylori strain B45, isolated from a patient with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The major finding was a 24.6-kb prophage integrated in the bacterial genome. The prophage shares most of its genes (22/27) with prophage region II of Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba. After UV treatment of liquid cultures, circular DNA carrying the prophage integrase gene could be detected, and intracellular tailed phage-like particles were observed in H. pylori cells by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that phage production can be induced from the prophage. PCR amplification and sequencing of the integrase gene from 341 H. pylori strains from different geographic regions revealed a high prevalence of the prophage (21.4%). Phylogenetic reconstruction showed four distinct clusters in the integrase gene, three of which tended to be specific for geographic regions. Our study implies that phages may play important roles in the ecology and evolution of H. pylori.\n\nHelicobacter pylori chronically infects the gastric mucosa in more than half of the human population, and while most of the infected individuals do not develop disease, H. pylori infection doubles the risk of developing gastric cancer. An abundance and diversity of viruses (phages) infect microbial populations in most environments and are important mediators of microbial diversity. Our finding of a 24.6-kb prophage integrated inside an H. pylori genome and the observation of circular integrase gene-containing DNA and phage-like particles inside cells upon UV treatment demonstrate that we have discovered a viable H. pylori phage. The additional finding of integrase genes in a large proportion of screened isolates of diverse geographic origins indicates that the prevalence of prophages may have been underestimated in H. pylori.

In the discovery study, nine loci demonstrated association with AAA (p < 1\u00a0\u00d7 10(-5)). In the replication sample, the lead SNP at one of these loci, rs1466535, located within intron 1 of low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) demonstrated significant association (p = 0.0042). We confirmed the association of rs1466535 and AAA in our follow-up study (p = 0.035). In a combined analysis (6228 AAA and 49182 controls), rs1466535 had a consistent effect size and direction in all sample sets (combined p = 4.52\u00a0\u00d7 10(-10), odds ratio 1.15 [1.10-1.21]). No associations were seen for either rs1466535 or the 12q13.3 locus in independent association studies of coronary artery disease, blood pressure, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia, suggesting that this locus is specific to AAA. Gene-expression studies demonstrated a trend toward increased LRP1 expression for the rs1466535 CC genotype in arterial tissues; there was a significant (p = 0.029) 1.19-fold (1.04-1.36) increase in LRP1 expression in CC homozygotes compared to TT homozygotes in aortic adventitia. Functional studies demonstrated that rs1466535 might alter a SREBP-1 binding site and influence enhancer activity at the locus. In conclusion, this study has identified a biologically plausible genetic variant associated specifically with AAA, and we suggest that this variant has a possible functional role in LRP1 expression.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.10.002", "pmid": "22055160", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0002-9297(11)00436-8"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3213391"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a6b88208359d498db34ce8a14fa0d829.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a6b88208359d498db34ce8a14fa0d829"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c80a312d950740c59df07b3869ac0159", "title": "A lateral flow protein microarray for rapid and sensitive antibody assays.", "authors": [{"family": "Gantelius", "given": "Jesper", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bass", "given": "Tarek", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6berg", "given": "Ronald", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Andersson-Svahn", "given": "Helene", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-11-09", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1422-0067", "issue": "11", "pages": "7748-7759", "title": "Int J Mol Sci"}, "abstract": "Protein microarrays are useful tools for highly multiplexed determination of presence or levels of clinically relevant biomarkers in human tissues and biofluids.

This database provides an important source of information for numerous biomedical research projects, including biomarker discovery efforts. Moreover, the global analysis of how our genome is expressed at the protein level has provided basic knowledge on the ubiquitous expression of a large proportion of our proteins and revealed the paucity of cell- and tissue-type-specific proteins.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02427.x", "pmid": "21752111", "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": "Technology development", "Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e07b816699de4cc785bc698cd13f8392.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e07b816699de4cc785bc698cd13f8392"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e85fbabce41642a5a4e00ff4b128069a", "title": "Western blotting via proximity ligation for high performance protein analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Liu", "given": "Yanling", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Gu", "given": "Jijuan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hagner-McWhirter", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Sathiyanarayanan", "given": "Poojahrau", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Gullberg", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derberg", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hammond", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ivansson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "10", "issn": "1535-9484", "issue": "11", "pages": "O111.011031", "title": "Mol.

The in situ proximity ligation assay, based on dual antibody recognition and powerful localized signal amplification, offers increased detection sensitivity and specificity, along with an ability to identify complex targets such as phosphorylated or interacting proteins. Here we have applied the in situ proximity ligation assay mechanism in Western blotting. This combination allowed the use of isothermal rolling circle amplification of DNA molecules formed in target-specific ligation reaction, for 16-fold or greater increase in detection sensitivity. The increased specificity because of dual antibody recognition ensured highly selective assays, detecting the specific band when combinations of two cross-reactive antitubulin antibodies were used (i.e. both producing distinct nonspecific bands in traditional Western blotting). We also demonstrated detection of phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 by proximity ligation with one antibody directed against the receptor and another directed against the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. This avoided the need for stripping and re-probing the membrane or aligning two separate traditional blots. We demonstrate that the high-performance in situ proximity ligation-based Western blotting described herein is compatible with detection via enhanced chemiluminescence and fluorescence detection systems, and can thus be readily employed in any laboratory.", "doi": "10.1074/mcp.O111.011031", "pmid": "21813417", "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "O111.011031"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3226413"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e85fbabce41642a5a4e00ff4b128069a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e85fbabce41642a5a4e00ff4b128069a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f1401f1407364e189b734a9b3e1582c0", "title": "Generation of monospecific antibodies based on affinity capture of polyclonal antibodies.", "authors": [{"family": "Hjelm", "given": "Barbara", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Forsstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Igel", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Johannesson", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Stadler", "given": "Charlotte", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6berg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rockberg", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "20", "issn": "1469-896X", "issue": "11", "pages": "1824-1835", "title": "Protein Sci."}, "abstract": "A method is described to generate and validate antibodies based on mapping the linear epitopes of a polyclonal antibody followed by sequential epitope-specific capture using synthetic peptides.

Hypermethioninemia is occasionally discovered incidentally, but it is often disregarded as an unspecific finding, particularly if liver disease is involved. In many individuals the hypermethioninemia resolves without further deterioration, but it can also represent an early sign of a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. Further investigation of unclear hypermethioninemia is therefore important. We studied two siblings affected by severe developmental delay and liver dysfunction. Biochemical analysis revealed increased plasma levels of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) but normal or mildly elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, indicating a block in the methionine cycle. We excluded S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) deficiency, which causes a similar biochemical phenotype, by using genetic and biochemical techniques and hypothesized that there was a functional block in the SAHH enzyme as a result of a recessive mutation in a different gene. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous c.902C>A (p.Ala301Glu) missense mutation in the adenosine kinase gene (ADK), the function of which fits perfectly with this hypothesis. Increased urinary adenosine excretion confirmed ADK deficiency in the siblings. Four additional individuals from two unrelated families with a similar presentation were identified and shown to have a homozygous c.653A>C (p.Asp218Ala) and c.38G>A (p.Gly13Glu) mutation, respectively, in the same gene.

Genes encoding the major components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, Dicer-like (Pidcl1), Argonaute (Piago1-5) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Pirdr1), were identified in the P. infestans genome by comparative genomics, together with families of other genes potentially involved in gene silencing, such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, DEAD helicases, chromodomain proteins and a class 1 RNaseIII. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated transcript accumulation for all candidate genes throughout the asexual lifecycle and plant infection, but at different levels of mRNA abundance. A functional assay was developed in which silencing of the sporulation-associated Picdc14 gene was released by the treatment of protoplasts with in vitro-synthesized double-stranded RNAs homologous to Pidcl1, Piago1/2 and histone deacetylase Pihda1.

Two loci (LARP6 and SGSM2) have not been previously related to metabolic traits, one (MADD) has been associated with fasting glucose, one (PCSK1) has been implicated in obesity, and four (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, VPS13C/C2CD4A/B, and ARAP1, formerly CENTD2) increase T2D risk. The proinsulin-raising allele of ARAP1 was associated with a lower fasting glucose (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10(-4)), improved \u03b2-cell function (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-5)), and lower risk of T2D (odds ratio 0.88; P = 7.8 \u00d7 10(-6)). Notably, PCSK1 encodes the protein prohormone convertase 1/3, the first enzyme in the insulin processing pathway. A genotype score composed of the nine proinsulin-raising alleles was not associated with coronary disease in two large case-control datasets.\n\nWe have identified nine genetic variants associated with fasting proinsulin.

A quantitative, high-density genetic interaction map revealed links between Mediator components and factors affecting chromatin structure, especially histone deacetylases. Peptide binding assays demonstrated that pure wild-type Mediator forms stable complexes with the tails of Histone H3 and H4. These binding assays also showed Mediator-histone H4 peptide interactions are specifically inhibited by acetylation of the histone H4 lysine 16, a residue critical in transcriptional silencing. Finally, these findings were validated by tiling array analysis that revealed a broad correlation between Mediator and nucleosome occupancy in vivo, but a negative correlation between Mediator and nucleosomes acetylated at histone H4 lysine 16.

Conversely, muscle-specific loss of Lin28a or overexpression of let-7 results in insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. These phenomena occur, in part, through the let-7-mediated repression of multiple components of the insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway, including IGF1R, INSR, and IRS2. In addition, the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, abrogates Lin28a-mediated insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose uptake.

Residues 10, 116, and 210 were targeted, and the activities with the alternative substrates, benzyl isothiocyanate and the prodrug azathioprine, undergoing divergent chemical reactions were monitored for comparison. In general, increased activities were found when the smaller residues Gly, Ser, and Ala replaced the original Thr210. The most active mutant T210G was further mutated at position 116, but no mutant showed enhanced catalytic activity. However, saturation mutagenesis of position 10 identified one double mutant T210G/I10C with 100-fold higher specific activity with indene 1,2-oxide than wild-type GST M2-2. This enhanced epoxide activity of 50 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1) resulted primarily from an increased k(cat) value (70 s(-1)). The specific activity is 24-fold higher than that of wild-type GST M1-1, which is otherwise the most proficient GST enzyme with epoxide substrates. A second double mutant T210G/I10W displayed 30-fold increased activity with azathioprine, 0.56 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1). In both double mutants, the replacement of Ile10 led to narrowed acceptance of alternative substrates. Ile10 is evolutionarily conserved in related class Mu GSTs. Conservation usually indicates preservation of a particular function, and in the Mu class, it would appear that the conserved Ile10 is not necessary to maintain catalytic functions but to prevent loss of broad substrate acceptance. In summary, our data underscore the facile transition between alternative substrate selectivity profiles in GSTs by a few mutations.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.039", "pmid": "21821040", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0022-2836(11)00804-7"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8e439b7d2309467a875a218e7ba3b1fe.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8e439b7d2309467a875a218e7ba3b1fe"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cbad22e00c3f4d66847be8d00ab25dc7", "title": "Large-scale protein profiling in human cell lines using antibody-based proteomics.", "authors": [{"family": "Fagerberg", "given": "Linn", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Str\u00f6mberg", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "El-Obeid", "given": "Adila", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Gry", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Kenneth", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Asplund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-09-02", "journal": {"volume": "10", "issn": "1535-3907", "issue": "9", "pages": "4066-4075", "title": "J.

Our results show that immunohistochemically determined protein profiles can categorize cell lines into groups that overall reflect the tumor tissue of origin and that hematological cell lines appear to retain their protein profiles to a higher degree than cell lines established from solid tumors. The two-group comparisons reveal well-characterized proteins as well as previously unstudied proteins that could be of potential interest for further investigations. Moreover, multiple myeloma cells and cells of myeloid origin were found to share a protein profile, relative to the protein profile of lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma cells, possibly reflecting their common dependency of bone marrow microenvironment.

Biol."}, "abstract": "Cilia are ubiquitous cell surface projections that mediate various sensory- and motility-based processes and are implicated in a growing number of multi-organ genetic disorders termed ciliopathies. To identify new components required for cilium biogenesis and function, we sought to further define and validate the transcriptional targets of DAF-19, the ciliogenic C. elegans RFX transcription factor. Transcriptional profiling of daf-19 mutants (which do not form cilia) and wild-type animals was performed using embryos staged to when the cell types developing cilia in the worm, the ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs), still differentiate. Comparisons between the two populations revealed 881 differentially regulated genes with greater than a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression. A subset of these was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Transgenic worms expressing transcriptional GFP fusions revealed CSN-specific expression patterns for 11 of 14 candidate genes. We show that two uncharacterized candidate genes, termed dyf-17 and dyf-18 because their corresponding mutants display dye-filling (Dyf) defects, are important for ciliogenesis.

In addition, the basolateral-to-apical permeability was investigated in the Caco-2 monolayers and the efflux ratios were calculated. The absence of active drug transport processes in 2/4/A1 cells allowed identification and modeling of structural elements affecting the passive permeability. For instance, small aromatic R(1) substituents and a small (bromo-) R(2) substituent were associated with a high passive permeability. Efflux studies in Caco-2 cells indicated that amide-substituted neutral hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine and leucine, in the R(1) position, reduced the apical-to-basolateral transport and enhanced the efflux.

We confirmed associations of several previously known CAD susceptibility loci (eg, 9p21.3:p<10(-33); LPA:p<10(-19); 1p13.3:p<10(-17)) as well as three recently discovered loci (COL4A1/COL4A2, ZC3HC1, CYP17A1:p<5\u00d710(-7)).

Genes related to signal transmission, e.g., ion channel genes, may be of interest in this respect in the context of bipolar disorder. In the present study, we analysed 803 SNPs in 55 genes related to aspects of signal transmission and calculated all combinations of three genotypes from the 3\u00d7803 SNP genotypes for 1355 controls and 607 patients with bipolar disorder. Four clusters of patient-specific combinations were identified. Permutation tests indicated that some of these combinations might be related to bipolar disorder.

A shift from aceticlastic acetate degradation to syntrophic acetate oxidation had previously been confirmed in this reactor. In a parallel control reactor, operating at constant ammonia levels (0.65-0.90 g NH(4)(+)-N L(-1)), acetate degradation proceeded via the aceticlastic pathway throughout the operating period (660 d). The acetogenic populations in the reactors were analysed using degenerated primers designed to target the functional gene encoding a key enzyme of the acetyl-CoA pathway, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS). The analysis consisted of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis coupled with the construction of clone libraries, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. The T-RFLP data obtained were statistically analysed by non-metric multidimensional scaling. The most abundant FTHFS genes recovered in the clone libraries were assigned to terminal restriction fragments of the T-RFLP profile. The results of the investigation clearly indicated that increased ammonia concentration substantially influenced the putative acetogenic population structure and caused two distinct shifts of the most abundant members; however, the identity of the dominating species remains unknown, as none of the genes had been identified previously. Despite the shifts in the population, the qPCR analysis revealed a relatively stable abundance of the acetogenic population throughout the operation.", "doi": "10.1264/jsme2.ME11123", "pmid": "21869569", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "JST.JSTAGE/jsme2/ME11123"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365334"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365335"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365336"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365337"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365339"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HM365340"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "HQ156223"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3aff75dc3c16442eb233d9aad15df027.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3aff75dc3c16442eb233d9aad15df027"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a19b8f04ff8a4fa8902afc4c54a0627f", "title": "Identification of cis- and trans-acting genetic variants explaining up to half the variation in circulating vascular endothelial growth factor levels.", "authors": [{"family": "Debette", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Visvikis-Siest", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Ming-Huen", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Ndiaye", "given": "Ndeye-Coumba", "initials": "NC"}, {"family": "Song", "given": "Ci", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Destefano", "given": "Anita", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Safa", "given": "Radwan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Azimi Nezhad", "given": "Mohsen", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sawyer", "given": "Douglas", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Marteau", "given": "Jean-Brice", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Xanthakis", "given": "Vanessa", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Siest", "given": "Gerard", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sullivan", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pfister", "given": "Michele", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Holly", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Choi", "given": "Seung-Hoan", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Lamont", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lind", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Qiong", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Fitzgerald", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ingelsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Vasan", "given": "Ramachandran S", "initials": "RS"}, {"family": "Seshadri", "given": "Sudha", "initials": "S"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-08-19", "journal": {"volume": "109", "issn": "1524-4571", "issue": "5", "pages": "554-563", "title": "Circ.

Although the heritability of circulating VEGF levels is high, little is known about its genetic underpinnings.\n\nOur aim was to identify genetic variants associated with circulating VEGF levels, using an unbiased genome-wide approach, and to explore their functional significance with gene expression and pathway analysis.\n\nWe undertook a genome-wide association study of serum VEGF levels in 3527 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, with preplanned replication in 1727 participants from 2 independent samples, the STANISLAS Family Study and the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors study.

The phenotype was remarkably similar and consisted of a round face with full cheeks, a high forehead, ptosis, cornea opacities, an underdeveloped alae, a short philtrum, a cupid's bow of the upper lip, down-turned corners of the mouth, micrognathia, low-set and prominent ears, and mild finger and toe anomalies (camptodactyly, syndactyly, and broadening of the first rays). Intellectual disability, hypotonia, decreased balance, sensorineural hearing loss, and unusual behavior were frequently observed. A high-resolution oligonucleotide array showed different proximal and distal breakpoints in all of the individuals. Sequencing studies in three of the individuals revealed that proximal and distal breakpoints were located in unique sequences with no apparent homology. The smallest region of overlap was a 539.7 kb interval encompassing three genes: a Zinc Finger Homeobox 4 (ZFHX4), one microRNA of unknown function, and one nonfunctional pseudogen. ZFHX4 encodes a transcription factor expressed in the adult human brain, skeletal muscle, and liver. It has been suggested as a candidate gene for congenital bilateral isolated ptosis.

results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.", "doi": "10.1038/nature10251", "pmid": "21833088", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature10251"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3182531"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "UKMS36028"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/63510104f3784bf9b3a3a73f29b7ae65.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/63510104f3784bf9b3a3a73f29b7ae65"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "952052b847a94bd796d1d8a6943902b9", "title": "Functional and prognostic relevance of the homeobox protein MSX2 in malignant melanoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Gremel", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ryan", "given": "D", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Rafferty", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lanigan", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hegarty", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lavelle", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Murphy", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Unwin", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Joyce", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Faller", "given": "W", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "McDermott", "given": "E W", "initials": "EW"}, {"family": "Sheahan", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gallagher", "given": "W M", "initials": "WM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-08-09", "journal": {"volume": "105", "issn": "1532-1827", "issue": "4", "pages": "565-574", "title": "Br.

Using genome-wide SNP data on 5174 Swedes with extensive geographical coverage, we analyzed the genetic structure of the Swedish population. We observed strong differences between the far northern counties and the remaining counties. The population of Dalarna county, in north middle Sweden, which borders southern Norway, also appears to differ markedly from other counties, possibly due to this county having more individuals with remote Finnish or Norwegian ancestry than other counties. An analysis of genetic differentiation (based on pairwise F(st)) indicated that the population of Sweden's southernmost counties are genetically closer to the HapMap CEU samples of Northern European ancestry than to the populations of Sweden's northernmost counties. In a comparison of extended homozygous segments, we detected a clear divide between southern and northern Sweden with small differences between the southern counties and considerably more segments in northern Sweden. Both the increased degree of homozygosity in the north and the large genetic differences between the south and the north may have arisen due to a small population in the north and the vast geographical distances between towns and villages in the north, in contrast to the more densely settled southern parts of Sweden. Our findings have implications for future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with respect to the matching of cases and controls and the need for within-county matching. We have shown that genetic differences within a single country may be substantial, even when viewed on a European scale.

Using a family-based design of offspring who attempted suicide (SA) and both parents, we investigated gene-environment interactions (G\u00d7Es) of SLE exposures with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1 (CRHR1), a major HPA axis regulatory gene.

In the water-surface microcosm assay, floating pathogen mycelium is used as a source for isolation of hyphae-colonizing soil bacteria (HCSB), which are subsequently screened for antagonism. Ten antagonistic soil bacteria (ASB) isolated from a variety of Vietnamese rice soils using dual-culture plates were found to be affiliated with Bacillus based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, all the ASB isolates grew poorly and showed no antagonism in the water-surface microcosm assay. In contrast, 11 (out of 13) HCSB isolates affiliated with Burkholderia sp. all grew well by colonizing the hyphae in the microcosms. Two of the Burkholderia sp. isolates, assigned to B. vietnamiensis based on recA gene sequencing, strongly inhibited fungal growth in both the dual-culture and water-surface microcosm assays; HCSB isolates affiliated to other species or species groups showed limited or no inhibition of R. solani in the microcosms.

Because the function of RBM3 has not been fully elucidated, the aim of this study was to use gene set enrichment analysis to identify the underlying biologic processes associated with RBM3 expression in a previously analyzed EOC cohort (cohort 1, n = 267). This revealed an association between RBM3 expression and several cellular processes involved in the maintenance of DNA integrity. RBM3-regulated genes were subsequently screened in the HPA to select for putative prognostic markers, and candidate proteins were analyzed in the ovarian cancer cell line A2780, whereby an up-regulation of Chk1, Chk2, and MCM3 was demonstrated in siRBM3-treated cells compared to controls. The prognostic value of these markers was assessed at the messenger RNA level in cohort 1 and the protein level in an independent EOC cohort (cohort 2, n = 154). High expression levels of Chk1, Chk2, and MCM3 were associated with a significantly shorter survival in both cohorts, and phosphorylated Chk2 was an adverse prognostic marker in cohort 2.

UDPS was performed using an optimized experimental protocol and an in-house data cleaning strategy. Nine samples and mixtures were analyzed and the average number of reads per sample was 19,404 (range 8,858-26,846). The two patient plasma samples were analyzed twice and quantification of viral variants was found to be highly repeatable for variants representing >0.27% of the virus population, whereas some variants representing 0.11-0.27% were detected in only one of the two UDPS runs. Bland-Altman analysis showed that a repeated measurement would have a 95% likelihood to lie approximately within \u00b10.5 log(10) of the initial estimate. A similar level of agreement was observed for variant frequency estimates in forward vs. reverse sequencing direction, but here the agreement was higher for common variants than for rare variants. UDPS following PCR amplification with alternative primers indicated that some variants may be incorrectly quantified due to primer-related selective amplification. Finally, the in vitro recombination rate during PCR was evaluated using artificial mixtures of clones and was found to be low. The most abundant in vitro recombinant represented 0.25% of all UDPS reads.\n\nThis study demonstrates that this UDPS protocol results in low experimental noise and high repeatability, which is relevant for future research and clinical use of the UDPS technology.

Histopathological and clinical information was obtained for available cases and tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from 226 (85.6%) suitable paraffin-embedded tumours and 31 metastases. RBM3 expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry on the TMAs and a subset of full-face sections. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison of RBM3 expression and relevant clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to assess the relationship between RBM3 and recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nRBM3 could be assessed in 215/226 (95.1%) of primary tumours and all metastases. Longitudinal analysis revealed that 16/31 (51.6%) of metastases lacked RBM3 expression, in contrast to the primary tumours in which RBM3 was absent in 3/215 (1.4%) cases and strongly expressed in 120/215 (55.8%) cases. Strong nuclear RBM3 expression in the primary tumour was significantly associated with favourable clinicopathological parameters; i.e. non-ulcerated tumours, lower depth of invasion, lower Clark level, less advanced clinical stage, low mitotic activity and non-nodular histological type, and a prolonged RFS (RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.27-0.91) and OS (RR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.20-0.64).

Genome-wide association analysis of these probes with 2.2 m SNPs revealed 131 potential eQTLs (1,989 eQTL SNPs) overlapping between the HapMap datasets, five of which were in cis (58 eQTL SNPs).

We identified nine potential SNP-QT associations (P<0.01) but none significantly replicated in five large consortia of 1,097-16,129 subjects.

Most of these taxa belonged to widespread families with opportunistic growth strategies, such as the Pseudomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae, indicating that neutrally assembled taxa may primarily be generalists.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of circulating lipid levels have identified numerous loci, a substantial portion of the heritability of these traits remains unexplained. Evidence of unexplained genetic variance can be detected by combining multiple independent markers into additive genetic risk scores. Such polygenic scores, constructed using results from the ENGAGE Consortium GWAS on serum lipids, were applied to predict lipid levels in an independent population-based study, the Rotterdam Study-II (RS-II). We additionally tested for evidence of a shared genetic basis for different lipid phenotypes. Finally, the polygenic score approach was used to identify an alternative genome-wide significance threshold before pathway analysis and those results were compared with those based on the classical genome-wide significance threshold. Our study provides evidence suggesting that many loci influencing circulating lipid levels remain undiscovered. Cross-prediction models suggested a small overlap between the polygenic backgrounds involved in determining LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels. Pathway analysis utilizing the best polygenic score for TC uncovered extra information compared with using only genome-wide significant loci. These results suggest that the genetic architecture of circulating lipids involves a number of undiscovered variants with very small effects, and that increasing GWAS sample sizes will enable the identification of novel variants that regulate lipid levels.", "doi": "10.1038/ejhg.2011.21", "pmid": "21448234", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ejhg201121"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3137496"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ac3ea9b6151417fa83ecfd62869be0e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ac3ea9b6151417fa83ecfd62869be0e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5303e6e8eb5743bb819fab14cfeb67b2", "title": "SATB2 in combination with cytokeratin 20 identifies over 95% of all colorectal carcinomas.", "authors": [{"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Kristina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "de Wit", "given": "Meike", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Brennan", "given": "Donal J", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Johnson", "given": "Louis B", "initials": "LB"}, {"family": "McGee", "given": "Sharon F", "initials": "SF"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Naicker", "given": "Kirsha", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Klinger", "given": "Rut", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kampf", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Asplund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wester", "given": "Kenneth", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Gry", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bjartell", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Gallagher", "given": "William M", "initials": "WM"}, {"family": "Rexhepaj", "given": "Elton", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kilpinen", "given": "Sami", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kallioniemi", "given": "Olli-Pekka", "initials": "OP"}, {"family": "Belt", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Goos", "given": "Jeroen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Meijer", "given": "Gerrit", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Birgisson", "given": "Helgi", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Glimelius", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Borrebaeck", "given": "Carl A K", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Navani", "given": "Sanjay", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "O'Connor", "given": "Darran P", "initials": "DP"}, {"family": "Jirstr\u00f6m", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "35", "issn": "1532-0979", "issue": "7", "pages": "937-948", "title": "Am.

In this respect, the SATB2 protein shows a selective pattern of expression and, within cells of epithelial lineages, SATB2 expression is restricted to glandular cells lining the lower gastrointestinal tract. The expression of SATB2 protein is primarily preserved in cancer cells of colorectal origin, indicating that SATB2 could function as a clinically useful diagnostic marker to distinguish colorectal cancer (CRC) from other types of cancer. The aim of this study was to further explore and validate the specific expression pattern of SATB2 as a clinical biomarker and to compare SATB2 with the well-known cytokeratin 20 (CK20). Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the extent of SATB2 expression in tissue microarrays with tumors from 9 independent cohorts of patients with primary and metastatic CRCs (n=1882). Our results show that SATB2 is a sensitive and highly specific marker for CRC with distinct positivity in 85% of all CRCs, and that SATB2 and/or CK20 was positive in 97% of CRCs. In conclusion, the specific expression of SATB2 in a large majority of CRCs suggests that SATB2 can be used as an important complementary tool for the differential diagnosis of carcinoma of unknown primary origin.", "doi": "10.1097/PAS.0b013e31821c3dae", "pmid": "21677534", "labels": {"Cell Profiling": null, "Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "00000478-201107000-00001"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5303e6e8eb5743bb819fab14cfeb67b2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5303e6e8eb5743bb819fab14cfeb67b2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "873af7a6da5647ed84b11169c37b9cee", "title": "Concomitant autoimmunity in myasthenia gravis--lack of association with IgA deficiency.", "authors": [{"family": "Ramanujam", "given": "Ryan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Piehl", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pirskanen", "given": "Ritva", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gregersen", "given": "Peter K", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "236", "issn": "1872-8421", "issue": "1-2", "pages": "118-122", "title": "J.

The aim of this study was to use GWA followed by multiple stepwise validations to identify additional genes associated with obesity.\n\nWe performed a GWA analysis in 164 morbidly obese subjects (BMI:body mass index>40 kg/m2) and 163 Swedish subjects (>45 years) who had always been lean. The 700 SNPs displaying the strongest association with obesity in the GWA were analyzed in a second cohort comprising 460 morbidly obese subjects and 247 consistently lean Swedish adults. 23 SNPs remained significantly associated with obesity (nominal P<0.05) and were in a step-wise manner followed up in five additional cohorts from Sweden, France, and Germany together comprising 4214 obese and 5417 lean or population-based control individuals. Three samples, n=4133, were used to investigate the population-based associations with BMI.

Syndecans are involved in many important cellular processes. Our recent publications have demonstrated that syndecan-1 translocates into the nucleus and hampers tumor cell proliferation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in tumor cell adhesion and migration, with special focus on the importance of its distinct protein domains, to better understand the structure-function relationship of syndecan-1 in tumor progression.\n\nWe utilized two mesenchymal tumor cell lines which were transfected to stably overexpress full-length syndecan-1 or truncated variants: the 78 which lacks the extracellular domain except the DRKE sequence proposed to be essential for oligomerization, the 77 which lacks the whole extracellular domain, and the RMKKK which serves as a nuclear localization signal. The deletion of the RMKKK motif from full-length syndecan-1 abolished the nuclear translocation of this proteoglycan. Various bioassays for cell adhesion, chemotaxis, random movement and wound healing were studied. Furthermore, we performed gene microarray to analyze the global gene expression pattern influenced by syndecan-1. Both full-length and truncated syndecan-1 constructs decrease tumor cell migration and motility, and affect cell adhesion. Distinct protein domains have differential effects, the extracellular domain is more important for promoting cell adhesion, while the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are sufficient for inhibition of cell migration. Cell behavior seems to depend also on the nuclear translocation of syndecan-1. Many genes are differentially regulated by syndecan-1 and a number of genes are actually involved in cell adhesion and migration.\n\nOur results demonstrate that syndecan-1 regulates mesenchymal tumor cell adhesion and migration, and different domains have differential effects.

Genome-wide SNP array analysis of affected individuals from both families showed an overlapping and homozygous region of 800 kb on the long arm of chromosome 8. The candidate region spans eight genes, and DNA sequence analysis revealed homozygous nonsense and missense mutations in FZD(6), the gene encoding Frizzled 6. FZD(6) belongs to a family of highly conserved membrane-bound WNT receptors involved in developmental processes and differentiation through several signaling pathways. We expressed the FZD(6) missense mutation and observed a quantitative shift in subcellular distribution from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes, where the receptor is inaccessible for signaling and presumably degraded. Analysis of human fibroblasts homozygous for the nonsense mutation showed an aberrant response to both WNT-3A and WNT-5A stimulation; this response was consistent with an effect on both canonical and noncanonical WNT-FZD signaling. A detailed analysis of the Fzd(6)(-/-) mice, previously shown to have an altered hair pattern, showed malformed claws predominantly of the hind limbs. Furthermore, a transient Fdz6 mRNA expression was observed in the epidermis of the digital tips at embryonic day 16.5 during early claw morphogenesis.

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed that the strains belong to the Firmicutes-Clostridia class.

The suitability of prostasomes as blood biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer was tested by using an expanded variant of the proximity ligation assay (PLA). We developed an extremely sensitive and specific assay (4PLA) for detection of complex target structures such as microvesicles in which the target is first captured via an immobilized antibody and subsequently detected by using four other antibodies with attached DNA strands. The requirement for coincident binding by five antibodies to generate an amplifiable reporter results in both increased specificity and sensitivity. The assay successfully detected significantly elevated levels of prostasomes in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy, compared with controls and men with benign biopsy results. The medians for prostasome levels in blood plasma of patients with prostate cancer were 2.5 to sevenfold higher compared with control samples in two independent studies, and the assay also distinguished patients with high and medium prostatectomy Gleason scores (8/9 and 7, respectively) from those with low score (\u2264 6), thus reflecting disease aggressiveness.

Cardinal features of CFC include congenital heart defects, a characteristic facial appearance, and ectodermal abnormalities. Additional features include failure to thrive with severe feeding problems, moderate to severe intellectual disability and short stature with relative macrocephaly.

This chemical approach is orthogonal to Ala or Cys scanning and allows the expansion of the repertoire of amino acid side chains far beyond those present in natural proteins. In its present application, we have introduced Cys-X residues in human glutathione transferase (GST) M2-2, replacing Met-212 in the substrate-binding site. To achieve selectivity of the modifications, the Cys residues in the wild-type enzyme were replaced by Ala. A suite of simple substitutions resulted in a set of homologous Met derivatives ranging from normethionine to S-heptyl-cysteine. The chemical modifications were validated by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The derivatized mutant enzymes were assayed with alternative GST substrates representing diverse chemical reactions: aromatic substitution, epoxide opening, transnitrosylation, and addition to an ortho-quinone. The Cys substitutions had different effects on the alternative substrates and differentially enhanced or suppressed catalytic activities depending on both the Cys-X substitution and the substrate assayed.

Mechanistic understanding of transcription in an organism thus requires detailed knowledge of binding affinities of all its TFs to all possible DNA sequences, and the co-operative interactions between the TFs. However, very little is known about such co-operative binding interactions, and even the simple TF-DNA binding information exists only for a very small proportion of all TFs - for example, mammals have approximately 1,300-2,000 TFs [1, 2], yet the largest public databases for TF binding specificity, Jaspar and Uniprobe [3, 4] currently list only approximately 500 moderate to high resolution profiles for human or mouse.

Our main focus was on the hippocampal formation (HiFo), amygdaloid complex, and hypothalamus, considering the known functions of NPY and the wide expression of NPY, Y1R, and Y2R in these regions. Y2R-like immunoreactivity (-LI) was distributed in nerve fibers/terminal endings throughout the brain axis, without apparent colocalization with NPY or the Y1R.

The results revealed that maternal criticism was primarily due to evocative rGE emanating from their adolescent's externalizing behavior. On the other hand, fathers' critical remarks tended to affect adolescent problem behavior in a direct environmental way. This suggests that previously reported differences in caretaking between mothers and fathers also are reflected in differences in why parenting is associated with externalizing behavior in offspring.", "doi": "10.1037/a0021815", "pmid": "21280930", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2011-01600-001"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3093313"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS289298"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c4d3e805f38848189e13204dcfd51b1a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c4d3e805f38848189e13204dcfd51b1a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a46d60b67e3c4ad1931e3df667e27017", "title": "Nitrogenase gene amplicons from global marine surface waters are dominated by genes of non-cyanobacteria.", "authors": [{"family": "Farnelid", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Bertilsson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Al-Soud", "given": "Waleed Abu", "initials": "WA"}, {"family": "Hansen", "given": "Lars H", "initials": "LH"}, {"family": "S\u00f8rensen", "given": "S\u00f8ren", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Steward", "given": "Grieg F", "initials": "GF"}, {"family": "Hagstr\u00f6m", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Riemann", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-04-29", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "4", "pages": "e19223", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are thought to be the main N(2)-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) in marine pelagic waters, but recent molecular analyses indicate that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are also present and active.

Our analysis of 79,090 nitrogenase (nifH) PCR amplicons encoding 7,468 unique proteins from surface samples (ten DNA samples and two RNA samples) collected at ten marine locations world-wide provides the first in-depth survey of a functional bacterial gene and yield insights into the composition and diversity of the nifH gene pool in marine waters. Great divergence in nifH composition was observed between sites. Cyanobacteria-like genes were most frequent among amplicons from the warmest waters, but overall the data set was dominated by nifH sequences most closely related to non-cyanobacteria. Clusters related to Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacteria were most common and showed distinct geographic distributions. Sequences related to anaerobic bacteria (nifH Cluster III) were generally rare, but preponderant in cold waters, especially in the Arctic. Although the two transcript samples were dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria, 42% of the identified non-cyanobacterial nifH clusters from the corresponding DNA samples were also detected in cDNA. The study indicates that non-cyanobacteria account for a substantial part of the nifH gene pool in marine surface waters and that these genes are at least occasionally expressed.

Aggregation of TTR in the form of amyloid fibrils is associated with neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms of cytotoxicity are likely to stem from the presence of intermediate assembly states. Characterization of these intermediate species is therefore essential to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of TTR-related amyloidoses. In the present work we used atomic force microscopy to investigate the morphological features of wild-type (WT) TTR amyloid protofibrils that appear in the early stages of aggregation. TTR protofibrils obtained by mild acidification appeared as flexible filaments with variable length and were able to bind amyloid markers (thioflavin T and Congo red). Surface topology and contour-length distribution displayed a periodic pattern of \u223c 15 nm, suggesting that the protofibrils assemble via an end-binding oligomer fusion mechanism. The average height and periodic substructure found in protofibrils is compatible with the double-helical model of the TTR amyloid protofilament. Over time protofibrils aggregated into bundles and did not form mature amyloid-like fibrils. Unlike amyloid fibrils that are typically stable under physiological conditions, the bundles dissociated into component protofibrils with axially compacted and radially dilated structure when exposed to phosphate-buffered saline solution. Thus, WT TTR can form metastable filamentous aggregates that may represent an important transient state along the pathway towards the formation of cytotoxic TTR species.", "doi": "10.1002/jmr.1112", "pmid": "21504025", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dbe52e1f133d4beb8fd0c3a4cc18ef06.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dbe52e1f133d4beb8fd0c3a4cc18ef06"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6020ba73a1074d6781fddb32a0955729", "title": "Clostridium botulinum group III: a group with dual identity shaped by plasmids, phages and mobile elements.", "authors": [{"family": "Skarin", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m", "given": "Therese", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Westerberg", "given": "Josefina", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Segerman", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-04-12", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": null, "pages": "185", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "Clostridium botulinum strains can be divided into four physiological groups that are sufficiently diverged to be considered as separate species.

The largest difference between C. botulinum group III isolates occurred within their surprisingly large plasmidomes and in the pattern of mobile elements insertions. Five plasmids, constituting 13.5% of the total genetic material, were present in the completed genome. Interestingly, the set of plasmids differed compared to other isolates. The largest plasmid, the botulinum-neurotoxin carrying prophage, was conserved at a level similar to that of the chromosome while the medium-sized plasmids seemed to be undergoing faster genetic drift. These plasmids also contained more mobile elements than other replicons.

From this versatile and reactive intermediate various heteroatom-linked substituents could be introduced on the scaffold including amines, ethers, amides and sulfonamides.

Although several genes have been identified which appear to be associated with MG, both classic twin studies and current multi-gene models are insufficient to explain either disease pathogenesis or inheritance. We examined the literature on MG to determine both mono- and dizygotic twin concordance rates, and used this data to (1) estimate the proportion of the population with underlying genetic predisposition to MG and the frequency of the environmental component and (2) derive the number of inherited genetic regions that are required to confer predisposition to MG. Using a MZ twin concordance rate of 35.5%, and a dizygotic rate of approximately 4-5% (based on family data), the probability of encountering environmental components necessary to develop MG in an individual with genetic predisposition is approximately 52.4%, making the frequency of predisposition (1:5240) roughly twice the rate of incidence.

These are the early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) gene, P=9.9 \u00d7 10(-5), OR 1.68, the family with sequence similarity 167 member A-B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (FAM167A-BLK) locus, P=4.7 \u00d7 10(-4), OR 1.37 and the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF4=Ox40L) gene, P=7.4 \u00d7 10(-4), OR 1.34. We also confirmed the association between primary SS and the IRF5/TNPO3 locus and the STAT4 gene. We found no association between the SNPs in these five genes and the presence of anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies. EBF1, BLK and TNFSF4 are all involved in B-cell differentiation and activation, and we conclude that polymorphisms in several susceptibility genes in the immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of primary SS.", "doi": "10.1038/gene.2010.44", "pmid": "20861858", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "gene201044"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/360adb2100cc47fdb8d5f1cb573f8f70.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/360adb2100cc47fdb8d5f1cb573f8f70"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "44ff17fa893645fda398ce68c707b6d8", "title": "Ultra-deep sequencing of mouse mitochondrial DNA: mutational patterns and their origins.", "authors": [{"family": "Ameur", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Stewart", "given": "James B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Freyer", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hagstr\u00f6m", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ingman", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Nils-G\u00f6ran", "initials": "NG"}, {"family": "Gyllensten", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "3", "pages": "e1002028", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Somatic mutations of mtDNA are implicated in the aging process, but there is no universally accepted method for their accurate quantification. We have used ultra-deep sequencing to study genome-wide mtDNA mutation load in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. Mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mutator mice) have 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. In addition, the mtDNA mutator mice have increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occur at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and can therefore not drive the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis shows that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings is inherited from their heterozygous mothers consistent with germline transmission. We found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, thus questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. In addition, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations. Our results from studies of mice thus indicate that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.", "doi":

Little is known about the influence of common genetic variants on albuminuria in both general and diabetic populations. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 63,153 individuals of European ancestry with genotype information from genome-wide association studies (CKDGen Consortium) and from a large candidate gene study (CARe Consortium) to identify susceptibility loci for the quantitative trait urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and the clinical diagnosis microalbuminuria.

We observed similar associations among 6981 African Americans in the CARe Consortium. The associations between this variant and both UACR and microalbuminuria were significant in individuals of European ancestry regardless of diabetes status. Finally, this variant associated with a 41% increased risk for the development of persistent microalbuminuria during 20 years of follow-up among 1304 participants with type 1 diabetes in the prospective DCCT/EDIC Study.

In humans, several genes have been implicated in this group of diseases, but the majority of cases remain unexplained. A similar periodic fever syndrome is relatively frequent in the Chinese Shar-Pei breed of dogs. In the western world, Shar-Pei have been strongly selected for a distinctive thick and heavily folded skin. In this study, a mutation affecting both these traits was identified. Using genome-wide SNP analysis of Shar-Pei and other breeds, the strongest signal of a breed-specific selective sweep was located on chromosome 13. The same region also harbored the strongest genome-wide association (GWA) signal for susceptibility to the periodic fever syndrome (p(raw)\u200a= 2.3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076, p(genome)\u200a= 0.01). Dense targeted resequencing revealed two partially overlapping duplications, 14.3 Kb and 16.1 Kb in size, unique to Shar-Pei and upstream of the Hyaluronic Acid Synthase 2 (HAS2) gene. HAS2 encodes the rate-limiting enzyme synthesizing hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the skin. HA is up-regulated and accumulates in the thickened skin of Shar-Pei. A high copy number of the 16.1 Kb duplication was associated with an increased expression of HAS2 as well as the periodic fever syndrome (p < 0.0001). When fragmented, HA can act as a trigger of the innate immune system and stimulate sterile fever and inflammation. The strong selection for the skin phenotype therefore appears to enrich for a pleiotropic mutation predisposing these dogs to a periodic fever syndrome. The identification of HA as a major risk factor for this canine disease raises the potential of this glycosaminoglycan as a risk factor for human periodic fevers and as an important driver of chronic inflammation.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1001332", "pmid": "21437276", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3060080"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9e240ec071d04bc6a6782376703f9f72.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9e240ec071d04bc6a6782376703f9f72"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a3efa561874145b4b41e3df3ac114ab9", "title": "Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits.", "authors": [{"family": "Speliotes", "given": "Elizabeth K", "initials": "EK"}, {"family": "Yerges-Armstrong", "given": "Laura M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hernaez", "given": "Ruben", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Lauren J", "initials": "LJ"}, {"family": "Palmer", "given": "Cameron D", "initials": "CD"}, {"family": "Gudnason", "given": "Vilmundur", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Eiriksdottir", "given": "Gudny", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Garcia", "given": "Melissa E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Launer", "given": "Lenore J", "initials": "LJ"}, {"family": "Nalls", "given": "Michael A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Clark", "given": "Jeanne M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Mitchell", "given": "Braxton D", "initials": "BD"}, {"family": "Shuldiner", "given": "Alan R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Butler", "given": "Johannah L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Tomas", "given": "Marta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hoffmann", "given": "Udo", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Hwang", "given": "Shih-Jen", "initials": "SJ"}, {"family": "Massaro", "given": "Joseph M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "O'Donnell", "given": "Christopher J", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Sahani", "given": "Dushyant V", "initials": "DV"}, {"family": "Salomaa", "given": "Veikko", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Schadt", "given": "Eric E", "initials": "EE"}, {"family": "Schwartz", "given": "Stephen M", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Siscovick", "given": "David S", "initials": "DS"}, {"family": "NASH CRN", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "GIANT Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "MAGIC Investigators", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Voight", "given": "Benjamin F", "initials": "BF"}, {"family": "Carr", "given": "J Jeffrey", "initials": "JJ"}, {"family": "Feitosa", "given": "Mary F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Harris", "given": "Tamara B", "initials": "TB"}, {"family": "Fox", "given": "Caroline S", "initials": "CS"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Albert V", "initials": "AV"}, {"family": "Kao", "given": "W H Linda", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Hirschhorn", "given": "Joel N", "initials": "JN"}, {"family": "Borecki", "given": "Ingrid B", "initials": "IB"}, {"family": "GOLD Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "3", "pages": "e1001324", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) clusters in families, but the only known common genetic variants influencing risk are near PNPLA3.

The nvCT spread rapidly with thousands of falsely negative diagnoses. Genome sequencing and phenotypic characterization showed that the biological fitness of nvCT when compared with wild-type CT in vitro is unaltered. Therefore, the rapid transmission of nvCT was due to the selective advantage gained from failed diagnosis and the introduction of nvCT into a high-frequency transmitting population. The proportions of nvCT cases are now converging toward equilibrium with the wild-type CT strains. Interestingly, the nvCT remains rarely reported beyond the Nordic countries.\n\nThe spread of nvCT had a substantial impact on C. trachomatis identification, epidemiology, and public health in Sweden. Lessons learned from this experience include the importance of investigating the incidence and epidemiology of infection in detail, the frequent participation in appropriate quality assurance schemes, and the careful design of diagnostic assays. The nvCT presents a unique opportunity to study the spread of a single C. trachomatis strain within both the human and bacterial populations; this may substantially increase our knowledge of epidemiology and transmission of chlamydial infections, and other sexually transmitted infections.", "doi": "10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834204d5", "pmid": "21157332", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/516b7d86ac29495cb3a9c713a3be0ae8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/516b7d86ac29495cb3a9c713a3be0ae8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9afcf3739ac84dc6b8c2a5395144172c", "title": "Genomic duplications mediate overexpression of lamin B1 in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) with autonomic symptoms.", "authors": [{"family": "Schuster", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sundblom", "given": "Jimmy", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Thuresson", "given": "Ann-Charlotte", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hassin-Baer", "given": "Sharon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Klopstock", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Dichgans", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Cohen", "given": "Oren S", "initials": "OS"}, {"family": "Raininko", "given": "Raili", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Melberg", "given": "Atle", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dahl", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2011-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1364-6753", "issue": "1", "pages": "65-72", "title": "Neurogenetics"}, "abstract": "Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) with autonomic symptoms features micturition urgency, constipation, erectile dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension, usually followed by pyramidal signs and ataxia.

It is generally considered as a sporadic disease and its molecular etiology is poorly understood. We report comprehensive clinical and molecular studies of 55 sporadic and familial patients diagnosed with this condition. Nine pedigrees encompassing 23 affected subjects were established, consistent with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Familial and sporadic patients demonstrated indistinguishable clinical pictures. Molecular analyses of 61 tumors from 45 individuals, including eight familial and 37 sporadic patients, aimed at determination of global copy number aberrations using BAC and Illumina SNP arrays and gene expression profiling by Affymetrix chips. Chromosome 18 aberrations were identified in both sporadic and in familial tumors; 100% vs. 38%, respectively. Other, less frequent aberrations were also common for both groups. Global expression profiles revealed no differentially expressed genes. Frequent gain of chromosome 7 was exclusively observed in metastases, when patient matched primary tumors and metastases were compared. Notably, the latter aberration correlated with solid growth pattern morphology (P < 0.01), a histopathological feature that has previously been related to worse prognosis.

Here, we have correlated the loss and recovery of the nigrostriatal DAergic functionality upon acute MPTP exposure with extensive gene expression analysis at the level of the ventral midbrain (VM) and striata (Str) and found a major upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and wingless-type MMTV integration site1 (Wnt1), a key transcript involved in midbrain DAergic neurodevelopment. Wnt signaling components (including Frizzled-1 [Fzd-1] and \u03b2-catenin) were dynamically regulated during MPTP-induced DAergic degeneration and reactive glial activation. Activated astrocytes of the ventral midbrain were identified as candidate source of Wnt1 by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR in vitro. Blocking Wnt/Fzd signaling with Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) counteracted astrocyte-induced neuroprotection against MPP(+) toxicity in primary mesencephalic astrocyte-neuron cultures, in vitro. Moreover, astroglial-derived factors, including Wnt1, promoted neurogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis from adult midbrain stem/neuroprogenitor cells, in vitro. Conversely, lack of Wnt1 transcription in response to MPTP in middle-aged mice and failure of DAergic neurons to recover were reversed by pharmacological activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, in vivo, thus suggesting MPTP-reactive astrocytes in situ and Wnt1 as candidate components of neuroprotective/neurorescue pathways in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2010.10.023", "pmid": "21056667", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0969-9961(10)00366-9"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3558878"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "EMS51159"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e196eff556fd47aa9db69794a88a5c31.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e196eff556fd47aa9db69794a88a5c31"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ef0fa515e7784205b0174e14717300cd", "title": "High-resolution genomic screening in mantle cell lymphoma--specific changes correlate with genomic complexity, the proliferation signature and survival.", "authors": [{"family": "Halld\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir", "given": "Anna M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Sander", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "G\u00f6ransson", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Isaksson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kimby", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Mansouri", "given": "Mahmoud", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rosenquist", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ehrencrona", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "50", "issn": "1098-2264", "issue": "2", "pages": "113-121", "title": "Genes Chromosomes Cancer"}, "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) and numerous copy number aberrations (CNAs).

Today, comprehensive databases of gene expression data enable us to apply increasingly more advanced computational methods for reverse-engineering the regulatory network of leaves, and to begin to understand the gene interactions underlying complex emergent properties related to stress-response and development. These new systems biology methods are now also being applied to organisms such as Populus, a woody perennial tree, in order to understand the specific characteristics of these species.\n\nWe present a systems biology model of the regulatory network of Populus leaves. The network is reverse-engineered from promoter information and expression profiles of leaf-specific genes measured over a large set of conditions related to stress and developmental. The network model incorporates interactions between regulators, such as synergistic and competitive relationships, by evaluating increasingly more complex regulatory mechanisms, and is therefore able to identify new regulators of leaf development not found by traditional genomics methods based on pair-wise expression similarity. The approach is shown to explain available gene function information and to provide robust prediction of expression levels in new data. We also use the predictive capability of the model to identify condition-specific regulation as well as conserved regulation between Populus and Arabidopsis.\n\nWe outline a computationally inferred model of the regulatory network of Populus leaves, and show how treating genes as interacting, rather than individual, entities identifies new regulators compared to traditional genomics analysis. Although systems biology models should be used with care considering the complexity of regulatory programs and the limitations of current genomics data, methods describing interactions can provide hypotheses about the underlying cause of emergent properties and are needed if we are to identify target genes other than those constituting the \"low hanging fruit\" of genomic analysis.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2229-11-13", "pmid": "21232107", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1471-2229-11-13"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3030533"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f0890af177f4d7d92a156e717f31f13.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7f0890af177f4d7d92a156e717f31f13"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "573cf957fd0d4486a6cf314387222a31", "title": "Vitamin D receptor genotypes, ultraviolet radiation exposure, and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Smedby", "given": "Karin Ekstr\u00f6m", "initials": "KE"}, {"family": "Eloranta", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Duvefelt", "given": "Kristina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Melbye", "given": "Mads", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Humphreys", "given": "Keith", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Hjalgrim", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Chang", "given": "Ellen T", "initials": "ET"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2011-01-01", "journal": {"volume": "173", "issn": "1476-6256", "issue": "1", "pages": "48-54", "title": "Am.

To explore the role of vitamin D in NHL risk and the potential interaction with UVR, the authors genotyped 10 VDR polymorphisms in 2,448 NHL patients and 1,981 controls from Denmark and Sweden who were recruited in 1999-2002. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed with logistic regression. P values were 2-sided. Most VDR variants (e.g., rs731236/TaqI, rs15444410/BsmI) were not associated with overall risk of NHL, but there was some evidence of a positive association between rs4760655 and follicular lymphoma risk (nominal P(trend) = 0.004, corrected P(trend) = 0.24). There was no support for an effect of interaction between VDR variants and UVR exposure on risk of overall NHL or B-cell lymphoma subtypes. However, there was some evidence that rs731236 altered associations between UVR and T-cell NHL risk; while increasing UVR frequency lowered T-cell NHL risk among rs731236 TT carriers, an elevated risk was observed among rs731236 CC carriers (nominal P(interaction) \u2264 0.008, corrected P(interaction) \u2265 0.12). VDR does not appear to harbor major determinants of NHL risk, except perhaps for follicular lymphoma.

It may be assumed that several mechanisms contribute to the injury. This study is an attempt to characterize the presumed components of the blast induced TBI. Our experimental models include a blast tube in which an anesthetized rat can be exposed to controlled detonations of explosives that result in a pressure wave with a magnitude between 130 and 260 kPa. In this model, the animal is fixed with a metal net to avoid head acceleration forces. The second model is a controlled penetration of a 2mm thick needle. In the third model the animal is subjected to a high-speed sagittal rotation angular acceleration. Immunohistochemical labeling for amyloid precursor protein revealed signs of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the penetration and rotation models. Signs of punctuate inflammation were observed after focal and rotation injury. Exposure in the blast tube did not induce DAI or detectable cell death, but functional changes. Affymetrix Gene arrays showed changes in the expression in a large number of gene families including cell death, inflammation and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus after both acceleration and penetration injuries. Exposure to the primary blast wave induced limited shifts in gene expression in the hippocampus. The most interesting findings were a downregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. These experiments indicate that rotational acceleration may be a critical factor for DAI and other acute changes after blast TBI. The further exploration of the mechanisms of blast TBI will have to include a search for long-term effects.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.05.031", "pmid": "20493951", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1053-8119(10)00763-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/16ac87c2a4b447b882f321708a5dc6e5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/16ac87c2a4b447b882f321708a5dc6e5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c078a6e6ac5a41028569854b10862c18", "title": "Targeted resequencing of candidate genes using selector probes.", "authors": [{"family": "Johansson", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Isaksson", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "S\u00f6rqvist", "given": "E Falk", "initials": "EF"}, {"family": "Roos", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Stenberg", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6blom", "given": "T", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Botling", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Micke", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Edlund", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Fredriksson", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kultima", "given": "H G\u00f6ransson", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Ericsson", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}], "type": "evaluation studies", "published": "2011-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "39", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "2", "pages": "e8", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "Targeted genome enrichment is a powerful tool for making use of the massive throughput of novel DNA-sequencing instruments.
