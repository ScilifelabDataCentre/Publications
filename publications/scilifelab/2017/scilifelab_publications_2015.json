We analyzed putative Salicoid duplicates in willows, originating from the Salicoid WGD, which took place more than 45 Mya. Contigs were constructed by de novo assembly of RNA-seq data derived from leaves and roots from two genotypes. Among the 48,508 contigs, 3,778 pairs were, based on fourfold synonymous third-codon transversion rates and syntenic positions, predicted to be Salicoid duplicates. Both copies were in most cases expressed in both tissues and 74% were significantly differentially expressed. Mean Ka/Ks was 0.23, suggesting that the Salicoid duplicates are evolving by purifying selection. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses showed that functions related to DNA- and nucleic acid binding were over-represented among the non-differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates, while functions related to biosynthesis and metabolism were over-represented among the differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates. We propose that the differentially expressed Salicoid duplicates are regulatory neo- and/or subfunctionalized, while the non-differentially expressed are dose sensitive, hence, functionally conserved.

These genomes represent novel species within typical freshwater and marine clades, including clades not previously sequenced. The genomes' seasonal dynamics follow phylogenetic patterns, but with fine-grained lineage-specific variations, reflected in gene-content. Signs of streamlining are evident in most genomes, and estimated genome sizes correlate with abundance variation across filter size fractions. Comparing the genomes with globally distributed metagenomes reveals significant fragment recruitment at high sequence identity from brackish waters in North America, but little from lakes or oceans. This suggests the existence of a global brackish metacommunity whose populations diverged from freshwater and marine relatives over 100,000 years ago, long before the Baltic Sea was formed (8000 years ago). This markedly contrasts to most Baltic Sea multicellular organisms, which are locally adapted populations of freshwater or marine counterparts.\n\nWe describe the gene content, temporal dynamics and biogeography of a large set of new bacterioplankton genomes assembled from metagenomes.

Genomic DNA was extracted from a sulfate-reducing, m-xylene-mineralizing enrichment culture isolated from groundwater of a benzene-contaminated sulfidic aquifer. The identical epsilonproteobacterial phylotype has previously been detected in toluene- or benzene-mineralizing, sulfate-reducing consortia enriched from the same site. Previous stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments with (13)C6-labeled benzene suggested that this phylotype assimilates benzene-derived carbon in a syntrophic benzene-mineralizing consortium that uses sulfate as terminal electron acceptor. However, the type of energy metabolism and the ecophysiological function of this epsilonproteobacterium within aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading consortia and in the sulfidic aquifer are poorly understood. Annotation of the epsilonproteobacterial population genome suggests that the bacterium plays a key role in sulfur cycling as indicated by the presence of an sqr gene encoding a sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and psr genes encoding a polysulfide reductase. It may gain energy by using sulfide or hydrogen/formate as electron donors. Polysulfide, fumarate, as well as oxygen are potential electron acceptors. Auto- or mixotrophic carbon metabolism seems plausible since a complete reductive citric acid cycle was detected. Thus the bacterium can thrive in pristine groundwater as well as in hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifers. In hydrocarbon-contaminated sulfidic habitats, the epsilonproteobacterium may generate energy by coupling the oxidation of hydrogen or formate and highly abundant sulfide with the reduction of fumarate and/or polysulfide, accompanied by efficient assimilation of acetate produced during fermentation or incomplete oxidation of hydrocarbons. The highly efficient assimilation of acetate was recently demonstrated by a pulsed (13)C2-acetate protein SIP experiment. The capability of nitrogen fixation as indicated by the presence of nif genes may provide a selective advantage in nitrogen-depleted habitats.

We set out to map candidate quantitative trait genes for egg fecundity in the chicken by combining quantitative trait locus mapping in an advanced intercross of wild by domestic chickens with expression quantitative trait locus mapping in the same birds. We measured individual egg fecundity in 232 intercross chickens in two consecutive trials, the second one aimed at measuring brooding. We found 12 loci for different aspects of egg fecundity. We then combined the genomic confidence intervals of these loci with expression quantitative trait loci from bone and hypothalamus in the same intercross. Overlaps between egg loci and expression loci, and trait-gene expression correlations identify 29 candidates from bone and five from hypothalamus. The candidate quantitative trait genes include fibroblast growth factor 1, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins L42 and L32. In summary, we found putative quantitative trait genes for egg traits in the chicken that may have been affected by regulatory variants under chicken domestication.

Here, we introduce an empirical strategy to study intraspecific variation in and selection upon the seminal fluid proteome.

Moreover, population divergence in relative SFP abundance across populations was large and remarkably multidimensional. Most importantly, variation in male SFP abundance across populations was associated with male sperm competition success and male ability to stimulate female egg production.\n\nOur study provides the first direct evidence for postmating sexual selection on standing intraspecific variation in SFP abundance and the pattern of divergence across populations in the seminal fluid proteome match the pattern predicted by the postmating sexual selection paradigm for SFP evolution.

In this study, the potential of three male human embryonic stem cell lines to differentiate towards male gonadal cells was explored by analysing their gene expression profiles. The human embryonic stem cell lines were cultured for 14 days as monolayers on supporting human foreskin fibroblasts or as spheres in suspension, and were differentiated using BMP7, or spontaneous differentiation by omitting exogenous FGF2. TLDA analysis revealed that in the undifferentiated state, these cell lines have diverse mRNA profiles and exhibit significantly different potentials for differentiation towards the cell types present in the male gonads. This potential was associated with important factors directing the fate of the male primordial germ cells in vivo to form gonocytes, such as SOX17 or genes involved in the NODAL/ACTIVIN pathway, for example. Stimulation with BMP7 in suspension culture resulted in up-regulation of cytoplasmic SOX9 protein expression in all three lines.

On a molecular level, ageing is associated with a reduction of telomere length, changes in metabolic and gene-transcription profiles and an altered DNA-methylation pattern. Lifestyle factors such as smoking or stress can impact some of these molecular processes and thereby affect the ageing of an individual. Here we demonstrate by analysis of 77 plasma proteins in 976 individuals, that the abundance of circulating proteins accurately predicts chronological age, as well as anthropometrical measurements such as weight, height and hip circumference. The plasma protein profile can also be used to identify lifestyle factors that accelerate and decelerate ageing. We found smoking, high BMI and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to increase the predicted chronological age by 2-6 years, while consumption of fatty fish, drinking moderate amounts of coffee and exercising reduced the predicted age by approximately the same amount.

Embryos were exposed via egg injection on day 7 to the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and effects on the metabolic profile on day 12 were compared with those caused by GW7647 and rosiglitazone, which are selective agonists to peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) and PPAR\u03b3, respectively. Analysis of the metabolite concentrations from allantoic fluid by Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation between the embryos exposed to GW7647, rosiglitazone, and vehicle control, respectively. In blood plasma only GW7647 caused a significant effect on the metabolic profile. PFOA induced embryo mortality and increased relative liver weight at the highest dose. Sublethal doses of PFOA did not significantly affect the metabolic profile in either matrix, although single metabolites appeared to be altered. Neonatal mortality by PFOA in the mouse has been suggested to be mediated via activation of PPAR\u03b1. However, we found no similarity in the metabolite profile of chicken embryos exposed to PFOA with those of embryos exposed to PPAR agonists. This indicates that PFOA does not activate PPAR pathways in our model at concentrations in eggs and embryos well above those found in wild birds.

'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression.

The causes of this bias are commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline. Here, we examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may more profoundly be shaped by limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome. Notably, if the X, as in primates, is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate (per promoter) prior to the X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this hypothesis using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. As predicted, the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Similarly, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Also as expected, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones (compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor) if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X (and the Z of birds), as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. As then further predicted, highly expressed tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed, both indicating that the trend is shaped by the maximal expression level not the breadth of expression per se. Importantly, a limit to the maximal expression level explains biased tissue of expression profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues whose tissue-specific genes are very highly expressed (e.g., secretory tissues, tissues abundant in structural proteins) are also tissues in which gene expression is relatively rare on the X chromosome. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X's gene content, gene expression, and evolution.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.1002315", "pmid": "26685068", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PBIOLOGY-D-15-00448"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4686125"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/58dcb6fc60df458ebf62a6574f7a993d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/58dcb6fc60df458ebf62a6574f7a993d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6a635f8a475444aa920906cddc9098d1", "title": "The Plant Genome Integrative Explorer Resource: PlantGenIE.org.", "authors": [{"family": "Sundell", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Mannapperuma", "given": "Chanaka", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Netotea", "given": "Sergiu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Delhomme", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Lin", "given": "Yao-Cheng", "initials": "YC"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6din", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Van de Peer", "given": "Yves", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Jansson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hvidsten", "given": "Torgeir R", "initials": "TR"}, {"family": "Street", "given": "Nathaniel R", "initials": "NR"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "208", "issn": "1469-8137", "issue": "4", "pages": "1149-1156", "title": "New Phytol."}, "abstract": "Accessing and exploring large-scale genomics data sets remains a significant challenge to researchers without specialist bioinformatics training.

Studies of the effect of antibiotic resistance on bacterial fitness are heavily biased toward target alterations. Here we investigated how the costs in the form of a severely impaired growth rate associated with resistance due to absence of two major outer membrane porins can be genetically compensated. We performed an evolution experiment with 16 lineages of a double mutant of Escherichia coli with the ompCF genes deleted, and reduced fitness and increased resistance to different classes of antibiotics, including the carbapenems ertapenem and meropenem. After serial passage for only 250 generations, the relative growth rate increased from 0.85 to 0.99 (susceptible wild type set to 1.0). Compensation of the costs followed two different adaptive pathways where upregulation of expression of alternative porins bypassed the need for functional OmpCF porins. The first compensatory mechanism involved mutations in the phoR and pstS genes, causing constitutive high-level expression of the PhoE porin. The second mechanism involved mutations in the hfq and chiX genes that disrupted Hfq-dependent small RNA regulation, causing overexpression of the ChiP porin. Although susceptibility was restored in compensated mutants with PhoE overexpression, evolved mutants with high ChiP expression maintained the resistance phenotype. Our findings may explain why porin composition is often altered in resistant clinical isolates and provide new insights into how bypass mechanisms may allow genetic adaptation to a common multidrug resistance mechanism.", "doi": "10.1093/molbev/msv195", "pmid": "26358402", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "msv195"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b80e71c30e34c0ba0cfdfc4f2d8fc99.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b80e71c30e34c0ba0cfdfc4f2d8fc99"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "75eed86d1a72489e8579fbd105541c14", "title": "Phenotypic expansion of visceral myopathy associated with ACTG2 tandem base substitution.", "authors": [{"family": "Klar", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Raykova", "given": "Doroteya", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gustafson", "given": "Elisabet", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "T\u00f3thov\u00e1", "given": "Iveta", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ameur", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wanders", "given": "Alkwin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dahl", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "23", "issn": "1476-5438", "issue": "12", "pages": "1679-1683", "title": "Eur.

FXR\u03b12 expression in Fxr(-/-) mouse liver activates a similar gene program and robustly decreases hepatic triglyceride levels. On the other hand, FXR\u03b11 reduces hepatic triglyceride content to a lesser extent and does so through regulation of lipogenic gene expression. Bioenergetic cues, such as fasting and exercise, dynamically regulate Fxr splicing in mouse liver to increase Fxr\u03b12 expression.\n\nOur results show that the main FXR variants in human liver (\u03b11 and \u03b12) reduce hepatic lipid accumulation through distinct mechanisms and to different degrees.

G.\u2009semen was sampled from six lakes distributed in two adjacent watersheds, which thereby comprised, both connected and non-connected lakes. The individual isolates were genotyped by amplified fragment length polymorphism. Several lake populations were differentiated from each other, but connectivity within watersheds could not explain the observed population genetic pattern. However, isolation by distance was moderate and might limit the gene flow among distant populations. In addition, we found low, but significant linkage disequilibrium, which indicates regular sexual recombination in this species, despite its high degree of asexual reproduction. Therefore, we conclude that the genetic properties of microalgae with occasional sexual reproduction essentially mirror regularly recombining species.

A few small studies indicate that the trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe) is a common selenium metabolite in humans.\n\nThis study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of selenium to TMSe.\n\nStudy individuals constituted subsamples of 2 cohorts: 1) pregnant women (n = 228) and their 5-y-old children (n = 205) in rural Bangladesh with poor selenium status [median urinary selenium (U-Se): 6.4 \u03bcg/L in mothers, 14 \u03bcg/L in children] and 2) women in the Argentinian Andes (n = 83) with adequate selenium status (median U-Se: 24 \u03bcg/L). Total U-Se and blood selenium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and urinary concentrations of TMSe were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/vapor generation/ICPMS. A genomewide association study (GWAS) was performed for 1,629,299 (after filtration) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Bangladeshi women (n = 72) by using Illumina Omni5M, and results were validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction.\n\nTMSe \"producers\" were prevalent (approximately one-third) among the Bangladeshi women and their children, in whom TMSe constituted \u223c10-70% of U-Se, whereas \"nonproducers\" had, on average, 0.59% TMSe. The TMSe-producing women had, on average, 2-\u03bcg U-Se/L higher concentrations than did the nonproducers. In contrast, only 3 of the 83 Andean women were TMSe producers (6-15% TMSe in the urine); the average percentage among the nonproducers was 0.35%. Comparison of the percentage of urinary TMSe in mothers and children indicated a strong genetic influence. The GWAS identified 3 SNPs in the indolethylamine N-methyltransferase gene (INMT) that were strongly associated with percentage of TMSe (P < 0.001, false-discovery rate corrected) in both cohorts.\n\nThere are remarkable population and individual variations in the formation of TMSe, which could largely be explained by SNPs in INMT. The TMSe-producing women had higher U-Se concentrations than did nonproducers, but further elucidation of the metabolic pathways of selenium is essential for the understanding of its role in human health.

Estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) leads to a relief of typical menopausal symptoms, benefits bone and muscle health, and is associated with tissue-specific gene expression profiles. As gene expression is controlled by epigenetic factors (including DNA methylation), many of which are environmentally sensitive, it is plausible that at least part of the HRT-associated gene expression is due to changes in DNA methylation profile. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns of white blood cells (WBCs) and their associations with body composition, including muscle and bone measures of monozygotic (MZ) female twin pairs discordant for HRT. We identified 7,855 nominally significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with 4,044 genes. Of the genes with DMRs, five (ACBA1, CCL5, FASLG, PPP2R2B, and UHRF1) were also differentially expressed. All have been previously associated with HRT or estrogenic regulation, but not with HRT-associated DNA methylation. All five genes were associated with bone mineral content (BMC), and ABCA1, FASLG, and UHRF1 were also associated with body adiposity. Our study is the first to show that HRT associates with genome-wide DNA methylation alterations in WBCs. Moreover, we show that five differentially expressed genes with DMRs associate with clinical measures, including body fat percentage, lean body mass, bone mass, and blood lipids.

The aim of this work is two-fold: on the one hand we want to show how combining different and somewhat complementary technologies is key to improving assembly quality and correctness, and on the other hand we present a de novo assembly pipeline we believe to be beneficial to core facility bioinformaticians. To demonstrate both the effectiveness of combining technologies and the simplicity of the pipeline, here we present the results obtained using the Dekkera bruxellensis genome.\n\nIn this work we used short-read Illumina data and long-read PacBio data combined with the extreme long-range information from OpGen optical maps in the task of de novo genome assembly and finishing. Moreover, we developed NouGAT, a semi-automated pipeline for read-preprocessing, de novo assembly and assembly evaluation, which was instrumental for this work.\n\nWe obtained a high quality draft assembly of a yeast genome, resolved on a chromosomal level.

To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs.

Contributions of \u03b4(2) were evident for 14 traits in twin models (average \u03b4(2)twin = 0.25, range 0.14-0.49), two of which also displayed significant \u03b4(2) in the GREMLd analyses (triglycerides \u03b4(2)SNP = 0.28 and waist circumference \u03b4(2)SNP = 0.19). On average, the proportion of h(2)SNP/h(2)twin was 70% for ADE-fitted traits (for which the best-fitting model included additive and dominant genetic and unique environmental components) and 31% for AE-fitted traits (for which the best-fitting model included additive genetic and unique environmental components). Independent evidence for contribution from shared environment, also in ADE-fitted traits, was obtained from self-reported within-pair contact frequency and age at separation. We conclude that despite the fact that additive genetics appear to constitute the bulk of genetic influences for most complex traits, dominant genetic variation might often be masked by shared environment in twin and family studies and might therefore have a more prominent role than what family-based estimates often suggest. The risk of erroneously attributing all inherited genetic influences (additive and dominant) to the h(2) in too-small twin studies might also lead to exaggerated \"missing heritability\" (the proportion of h(2) that remains unexplained by SNPs).", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.10.004", "pmid": "26544805", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0002-9297(15)00406-1"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4667127"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1689bf73e1454cd39f7bf4f6c2468232.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1689bf73e1454cd39f7bf4f6c2468232"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1988d3d3ea4940688583a3c7799c7ea6", "title": "Intra-mitochondrial Methylation Deficiency Due to Mutations in SLC25A26.", "authors": [{"family": "Kishita", "given": "Yoshihito", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Pajak", "given": "Aleksandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bolar", "given": "Nikhita Ajit", "initials": "NA"}, {"family": "Marobbio", "given": "Carlo M T", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Maffezzini", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Miniero", "given": "Daniela V", "initials": "DV"}, {"family": "Monn\u00e9", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kohda", "given": "Masakazu", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Stranneheim", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Murayama", "given": "Kei", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Naess", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lesko", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bruhn", "given": "Helene", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mourier", "given": "Arnaud", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wibom", "given": "Rolf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nennesmo", "given": "Inger", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Jespers", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Govaert", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ohtake", "given": "Akira", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Van Laer", "given": "Lut", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Loeys", "given": "Bart L", "initials": "BL"}, {"family": "Freyer", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Palmieri", "given": "Ferdinando", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Wredenberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Okazaki", "given": "Yasushi", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Wedell", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-11-05", "journal": {"volume": "97", "issn": "1537-6605", "issue": "5", "pages": "761-768", "title": "Am.

The strategy relies on the construction of a composite genome combining all genetic data in a compact format, which can accommodate the fusion with quantitative peptide and protein information determined via DIA-MS. We demonstrate the method by combining data sets from whole genome sequencing, shotgun MS and DIA-MS from 34 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes.

Tissue microarray analysis demonstrated that vascular expression of CD93 was correlated with poor survival in a clinical cohort of patients with high-grade astrocytic glioma. Similarly, intracranial growth in the GL261 mouse model of glioma was delayed significantly in CD93(-/-) hosts, resulting in improved survival compared with wild-type mice. This effect was associated with increased vascular permeability and decreased vascular perfusion of tumors, indicating reduced vessel functionality in the absence of CD93. RNAi-mediated attenuation of CD93 in endothelial cells diminished VEGF-induced tube formation in a three-dimensional collagen gel. CD93 was required for efficient endothelial cell migration and proper cell polarization in vitro. Further, in endothelial cells where CD93 was attenuated, decreased cell spreading led to a severe reduction in cell adhesion, a lack of proper cell contacts, a loss of VE-cadherin, and aberrant actin stress fiber formation.

Possible weight loss differences between genotypes were tested with multiple linear regressions.\n\nThe per-allele effect of each FTO A-allele on excessive BMI loss (EBMIL) was 3 % (P\u2009=\u20090.02). When split by baseline status, the EBMIL of vitamin D-deficient patients carrying AA exceeded that of vitamin D-deficient patients carrying TT by ~14 % (P\u2009=\u20090.03). No such genotypic differences were found in patients without presurgery vitamin D deficiency. Post-surgery serum levels of vitamin D did not differ between groups.\n\nOur data suggest that presurgery vitamin D levels influence the size of genotype effects of FTO rs9939609 on RYGB surgery-induced weight loss in obese patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s11695-015-1644-4", "pmid": "25724814", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s11695-015-1644-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4595530"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/117b2d30ee0c40ffafc1491f817c3bb0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/117b2d30ee0c40ffafc1491f817c3bb0"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2acaefa3aa994d84bb23367986a3a7d9", "title": "Resolving Evolutionary Relationships in Closely Related Species with Whole-Genome Sequencing Data.", "authors": [{"family": "Nater", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Burri", "given": "Reto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kawakami", "given": "Takeshi", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Smeds", "given": "Linn\u00e9a", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ellegren", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "64", "issn": "1076-836X", "issue": "6", "pages": "1000-1017", "title": "Syst.

However, reconstructing the sequence of speciation events, the so-called species tree, in closely related and potentially hybridizing species is very challenging. Processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow result in local gene genealogies that differ in their topology from the species tree, and analyses of few loci with a single sequence per species are likely to produce conflicting or even misleading results. To study these phenomena on a full phylogenomic scale, we use whole-genome sequence data from 200 individuals of four black-and-white flycatcher species with so far unresolved phylogenetic relationships to infer gene tree topologies and visualize genome-wide patterns of gene tree incongruence. Using phylogenetic analysis in nonoverlapping 10-kb windows, we show that gene tree topologies are extremely diverse and change on a very small physical scale. Moreover, we find strong evidence for gene flow among flycatcher species, with distinct patterns of reduced introgression on the Z chromosome. To resolve species relationships on the background of widespread gene tree incongruence, we used four complementary coalescent-based methods for species tree reconstruction, including complex modeling approaches that incorporate post-divergence gene flow among species. This allowed us to infer the most likely species tree with high confidence. Based on this finding, we show that regions of reduced effective population size, which have been suggested as particularly useful for species tree inference, can produce positively misleading species tree topologies. Our findings disclose the pitfalls of using loci potentially under selection as phylogenetic markers and highlight the potential of modeling approaches to disentangle species relationships in systems with large effective population sizes and post-divergence gene flow.", "doi": "10.1093/sysbio/syv045", "pmid": "26187295", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "syv045"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4604831"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2acaefa3aa994d84bb23367986a3a7d9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2acaefa3aa994d84bb23367986a3a7d9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2ef850b84acd434aa7c54a25ba33744d", "title": "High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals Drastic Changes in Fungal Communities in the Phyllosphere of Norway Spruce (Picea abies) Following Invasion of the Spruce Bud Scale (Physokermes piceae).", "authors": [{"family": "Menkis", "given": "Audrius", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mar\u010diulynas", "given": "Adas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Gedminas", "given": "Art\u016bras", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lynikien\u0117", "given": "J\u016brat\u0117", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Povilaitien\u0117", "given": "Aist\u0117", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "70", "issn": "1432-184X", "issue": "4", "pages": "904-911", "title": "Microb.

Sampling was done in July 2013 and included 50 random lateral shoots from ten random trees in each of five visually undamaged and five damaged 40-50-year-old pure stands of P. abies. DNA was isolated from 500 individual shoots, subjected to amplification of the internal transcribed spacer of fungal ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA), barcoded and sequenced. Clustering of 149,426 high-quality sequences resulted in 1193 non-singleton contigs of which 1039 (87.1 %) were fungal. In total, there were 893 fungal taxa in damaged shoots and 608 taxa in undamaged shoots (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Furthermore, 431 (41.5 %) fungal taxa were exclusively in damaged shoots, 146 (14.0 %) were exclusively in undamaged shoots, and 462 (44.5 %) were common to both types of samples. Correspondence analysis showed that study sites representing damaged and undamaged shoots were separated from each other, indicating that in these fungal communities, these were largely different and, therefore, heavily affected by P. piceae. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that invasive alien tree pests may have a profound effect on fungal mycobiota associated with the phyllosphere of P. abies, and therefore, in addition to their direct negative effect owing physical damage of the tissue, they may also indirectly determine health, sustainability and, ultimately, distribution of the forest tree species.", "doi": "10.1007/s00248-015-0638-z", "pmid": "26054703", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00248-015-0638-z"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ef850b84acd434aa7c54a25ba33744d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2ef850b84acd434aa7c54a25ba33744d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "33f7af61ba0a45cab2e4aab5b48fd7c1", "title": "Mutation in CEP63 co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in a Swedish family.", "authors": [{"family": "Einarsdottir", "given": "Elisabet", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Idor", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Darki", "given": "Fahimeh", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Peyrard-Janvid", "given": "Myriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lindvall", "given": "Jessica M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Ameur", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Jacobsson", "given": "Christer", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Klingberg", "given": "Torkel", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Kere", "given": "Juha", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Matsson", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}], "type": "case reports", "published": "2015-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "134", "issn": "1432-1203", "issue": "11-12", "pages": "1239-1248", "title": "Hum.

Our approach in the current study was to perform exome sequencing of affected and unaffected individuals within an extended pedigree with a familial form of developmental dyslexia. We identified a two-base mutation, causing a p.R229L amino acid substitution in the centrosomal protein 63 kDa (CEP63), co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in this pedigree. This mutation is novel, and predicted to be highly damaging for the function of the protein. 3D modelling suggested a distinct conformational change caused by the mutation. CEP63 is localised to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells and is required for maintaining normal centriole duplication and control of cell cycle progression. We found that a common polymorphism in the CEP63 gene had a significant association with brain white matter volume. The brain regions were partly overlapping with the previously reported region influenced by polymorphisms in the dyslexia susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319.

Malassezia are typically isolated from warm-blooded animals, are dominant members of the human skin mycobiome and are associated with common skin disorders. To characterize the genetic basis of the unique phenotypes of Malassezia spp., we sequenced the genomes of all 14 accepted species and used comparative genomics against a broad panel of fungal genomes to comprehensively identify distinct features that define the Malassezia gene repertoire: gene gain and loss; selection signatures; and lineage-specific gene family expansions. Our analysis revealed key gene gain events (64) with a single gene conserved across all Malassezia but absent in all other sequenced Basidiomycota. These likely horizontally transferred genes provide intriguing gain-of-function events and prime candidates to explain the emergence of Malassezia. A larger set of genes (741) were lost, with enrichment for glycosyl hydrolases and carbohydrate metabolism, concordant with adaptation to skin's carbohydrate-deficient environment. Gene family analysis revealed extensive turnover and underlined the importance of secretory lipases, phospholipases, aspartyl proteases, and other peptidases. Combining genomic analysis with a re-evaluation of culture characteristics, we establish the likely lipid-dependence of all Malassezia.

All known members display obligate intracellular lifestyles, and the best-studied genera, Rickettsia and Orientia, include species that are hosted by terrestrial arthropods. Their obligate intracellular lifestyle and host adaptation is reflected in the small size of their genomes, a general feature shared with all other families of the Rickettsiales.

Intriguingly, phylogenomic and comparative analysis of the partial 'Candidatus Arcanobacter lacustris' genome revealed the presence chemotaxis genes and vertically inherited flagellar genes, a novelty in sequenced Rickettsiaceae, as well as several host-associated features.

In conclusion, our analysis based on transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling reports here comprehensive lists of genes with elevated expression levels in the endometrium, providing important starting points for a better molecular understanding of human reproductive biology and disease.", "doi": "10.1089/omi.2015.0115", "pmid": "26488136", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Technology development", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/599626457fda4ba3b2d8135ec113c389.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/599626457fda4ba3b2d8135ec113c389"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5e9934efa63c475ca2645fcc576fe2a0", "title": "Early Exposure to Dogs and Farm Animals and the Risk of Childhood Asthma.", "authors": [{"family": "Fall", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lundholm", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "\u00d6rtqvist", "given": "Anne K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Fall", "given": "Katja", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Fang", "given": "Fang", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hedhammar", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "K\u00e4mpe", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Ingelsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Almqvist", "given": "Catarina", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "169", "issn": "2168-6211", "issue": "11", "pages": "e153219", "title": "JAMA Pediatr"}, "abstract": "The association between early exposure to animals and childhood asthma is not clear, and previous studies have yielded contradictory results.\n\nTo determine whether exposure to dogs and farm animals confers a risk of asthma.\n\nIn a nationwide cohort study, the association between early exposure to dogs and farm animals and the risk of asthma was evaluated and included all children born in Sweden from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010 (N\u2009=\u20091,011,051), using registry data on dog and farm registration, asthma medication, diagnosis, and confounders for parents and their children. The association was assessed as the odds ratio (OR) for a current diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years for school-aged children and as the hazard ratio (HR) for incident asthma at ages 1 to 5 years for preschool-aged children.

Few studies have compared the metabolic differences between eating meat and fish.\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the postprandial plasma metabolic response to meals containing baked beef, baked herring, and pickled herring.\n\nSeventeen overweight men (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2), 41-67 y of age) were included in a randomized crossover intervention study. Subjects ate baked herring-, pickled herring-, and baked beef-based meals in a randomized order and postprandial blood plasma samples were taken over 7 h. Plasma metabolomics were measured with the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and areas under the curve for detected metabolites were compared between meals.\n\nThe plasma postprandial response of 2-aminoadipic acid, a suggested marker of diabetes risk, was 1.6 times higher after the beef meal than after the baked herring meal (P < 0.001). Plasma \u03b2-alanine and 4-hydroxyproline both were markedly greater after beef intake than after herring intake (16 and 3.4 times the response of baked herring, respectively; P < 0.001). Herring intake led to a greater plasma postprandial response from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and cetoleic acid compared with beef (17.6 and 150 times greater, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas hippuric acid and benzoic acid were elevated after pickled herring compared with baked herring (5.4 and 43 times higher; P < 0.001).\n\nThese results in overweight men confirm that DHA and cetoleic acid reflect herring intake, whereas \u03b2-alanine and 4-hydroxyproline are potential biomarkers for beef intake. The greater postprandial rise in 2-aminoadipic acid after the beef meal, coupled to its proposed role in stimulating insulin secretion, may have importance in the context of red meat intake and increased diabetes risk.

It would be unfortunate if different experiments were in fact incomparable, as there is great promise in data fusion and meta-analysis applied to sequencing data sets. We therefore compared reported gene expression measurements for ostensibly similar samples (specifically, human brain, heart and kidney samples) in several different RNA-seq studies to assess their overall consistency and to examine the factors contributing most to systematic differences.

Recent studies have documented highly heterogeneous differentiation landscapes, with distinct regions of elevated differentiation (\"differentiation islands\") widespread across genomes. However, it remains unclear which processes drive the evolution of differentiation islands; how the differentiation landscape evolves as speciation advances; and ultimately, how differentiation islands are related to speciation. Here, we addressed these questions based on population genetic analyses of 200 resequenced genomes from 10 populations of four Ficedula flycatcher sister species. We show that a heterogeneous differentiation landscape starts emerging among populations within species, and differentiation islands evolve recurrently in the very same genomic regions among independent lineages. Contrary to expectations from models that interpret differentiation islands as genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation that are shielded from gene flow, patterns of sequence divergence (d(xy) and relative node depth) do not support a major role of gene flow in the evolution of the differentiation landscape in these species. Instead, as predicted by models of linked selection, genome-wide variation in diversity and differentiation can be explained by variation in recombination rate and the density of targets for selection. We thus conclude that the heterogeneous landscape of differentiation in Ficedula flycatchers evolves mainly as the result of background selection and selective sweeps in genomic regions of low recombination. Our results emphasize the necessity of incorporating linked selection as a null model to identify genome regions involved in adaptation and speciation.", "doi": "10.1101/gr.196485.115", "pmid": "26355005", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "gr.196485.115"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4617962"}, {"db": "BioProject", "key": "PRJEB7359"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d736c0632ca049dfbec9183701a4995e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d736c0632ca049dfbec9183701a4995e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dedf0d2c3af14564a3d83c4999f11ea1", "title": "Variant Profiling of Candidate Genes in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Huang", "given": "Jiaqi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "L\u00f6hr", "given": "Johannes-Matthias", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Segersv\u00e4rd", "given": "Ralf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Matsson", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Verbeke", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Heuchel", "given": "Rainer", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kere", "given": "Juha", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Iafrate", "given": "A John", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Zheng", "given": "Zongli", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Ye", "given": "Weimin", "initials": "W"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "61", "issn": "1530-8561", "issue": "11", "pages": "1408-1416", "title": "Clin.

In this study, we use metagenomics to characterize periphyton communities from the marine environment of the Swedish west coast. Although we found approximately ten times more eukaryotic rRNA marker gene sequences compared to prokaryotic, the whole metagenome-based similarity searches showed that bacteria constitute the most abundant phyla in these biofilms. We show that marine periphyton encompass a range of heterotrophic and phototrophic organisms. Heterotrophic bacteria, including the majority of proteobacterial clades and Bacteroidetes, and eukaryotic macro-invertebrates were found to dominate periphyton. The phototrophic groups comprise Cyanobacteria and the alpha-proteobacterial genus Roseobacter, followed by different micro- and macro-algae. We also assess the metabolic pathways that predispose these communities to an attached lifestyle. Functional indicators of the biofilm form of life in periphyton involve genes coding for enzymes that catalyze the production and degradation of extracellular polymeric substances, mainly in the form of complex sugars such as starch and glycogen-like meshes together with chitin.

Here we aimed at exploring the abundance of chromosomal quinolone resistance mutations in Escherichia communities residing in the gut of Swedish travellers, and to determine potential changes after visiting India. Sweden is a country with a comparably low degree of quinolone use and quinolone resistance, whereas the opposite is true for India.\n\nMassively parallel amplicon sequencing targeting the quinolone-resistance determining region of gyrA and parC was applied to total DNA extracted from faecal samples. Paired samples were collected from 12 Swedish medical students before and after a 4-15 week visit to India. Twelve Indian residents were included for additional comparisons. Methods known resistance mutations were common in Swedes before travel as well as in Indians, with a trend for all mutations to be more common in the Indian sub group. There was a significant increase in the abundance of the most common amino acid substitution in GyrA (S83L, from 44 to 72%, p=0.036) in the samples collected after return to Sweden. No other substitution, including others commonly associated with quinolone resistance (D87N in GyrA, S80I in ParC) changed significantly. The number of distinct genotypes encoded in each traveller was significantly reduced after their visit to India for both GyrA (p=0.0020) and ParC (p=0.0051), indicating a reduced genetic diversity, similar to that found in the Indians.\n\nInternational travel can alter the composition of the Escherichia communities in the faecal flora, favouring bacteria carrying certain resistance mutations, and, thereby, contributes to the global spread of antibiotic resistance.

Moreover, by RNA sequencing we analyzed the extent of genome-wide effects on gene expression resulting from expression of human \u03b1-synuclein in primary mouse DA neurons. The results implicated the transcription factor Nurr1 as a key dysregulated target of \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. Forced Nurr1 expression restored the expression of hundreds of dysregulated genes in primary DA neurons expressing \u03b1-synuclein, and therefore prompted us to test the possibility that Nurr1 can be pharmacologically targeted by bexarotene, a ligand for the retinoid X receptor that forms heterodimers with Nurr1. Although our data demonstrated that bexarotene was ineffective in neuroprotection in rats in vivo, the results revealed that bexarotene has the capacity to coregulate subsets of Nurr1 target genes including the receptor tyrosine kinase subunit Ret. Moreover, bexarotene was able to restore dysfunctional Ret-dependent neurotrophic signaling in \u03b1-synuclein-overexpressing mouse DA neurons. These data highlight the role of the Nurr1-Ret signaling pathway as a target of \u03b1-synuclein toxicity and suggest that retinoid X receptor ligands with appropriate pharmacological properties could have therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease.\n\nHow \u03b1-synuclein, a protein enriched in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, is causing neuropathology in dopamine neurons remains unclear. This study elucidated how \u03b1-synuclein is influencing gene expression and how Nurr1, a transcription factor known to protect dopamine neurons against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity, can counteract these effects. Moreover, given the protective role of Nurr1, this study also investigated how Nurr1 could be pharmacologically targeted via bexarotene, a ligand of Nurr1's heterodimerization partner retinoid X receptor (RXR). The results showed that RXR ligands could increase neurotrophic signaling, but provided a mixed picture of its potential in a Parkinson's disease rat model in vivo. However, this study clearly emphasized Nurr1's neuroprotective role and indicated that other RXR ligands could have therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1155-15.2015", "pmid": "26490873", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "35/42/14370"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7b1d9e0720374cf5905addfea62090f5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7b1d9e0720374cf5905addfea62090f5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4e8b4856e2284782a9664cdf229e8c7e", "title": "Membrane vesicle-mediated release of bacterial RNA.", "authors": [{"family": "Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "given": "Annika E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Sandblad", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Uhlin", "given": "Bernt Eric", "initials": "BE"}, {"family": "Wai", "given": "Sun Nyunt", "initials": "SN"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-20", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "15329", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Many Gram-negative bacterial species release outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that interact with the host by delivering virulence factors.

The draft genome sequence of B. suanatina strain AN4859/03 was determined and compared with the available genomes of all valid species of Brachyspira.\n\nAccording to morphological traits, growth characteristics and enzymatic profiles, B. suanatina was similar to the type strain of B. hyodysenteriae, but using the recommended threshold value of 70% similarity by DDH it did not belong to any of the recognized Brachyspira species (range 16-64% similarity). This was further supported by average nucleotide identity values. Phylogenetic analysis performed using housekeeping genes and core genomes of all valid Brachyspira sp. and \"B. hampsonii\" revealed that B. suanatina and B. intermedia formed a clade distinct from B. hyodysenteriae. By comparing the genomes of the three closely related species B. intermedia, B. hyodysenteriae and B. suanatina similar profiles of general genomic features and distribution of genes in different functional categories were obtained.

Willows are woody perennials in the Salicaceae plant family that are grown as bioenergy crops worldwide.\n\nAn experiment was conducted where plants were exposed to drought and different eco-physiological parameters were assessed. RNA-seq data was furthermore generated with the Illumina technology from root tips and leaves from plants grown in drought and well-watered (WW) conditions. The RNA-seq data was assembled de novo with the Trinity assembler to create a reference gene set to which the reads were mapped in order to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the drought and WW conditions. To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in the drought response, GO enrichment analyses were conducted. Candidate genes with a putative function in the drought response were also identified.\n\nA total of 52,599 gene models were obtained and after filtering on gene expression (FPKM \u2265 1), 35,733 gene models remained, of which 24,421 contained open reading frames. A total of 5,112 unique DEGs were identified between drought and WW conditions, of which the majority were found in the root tips.

At the transcriptional level, genotype 520 displayed a greater response in the leaves as more DEGs were found in genotype 520 compared to genotype 592. In contrast, the transcriptional responses in the root tips were rather similar between the two genotypes. A core set of candidate genes encoding proteins with a putative function in drought response was identified, for example MYBs and bZIPs as well as chlorophyll a/b binding proteins.\n\nWe found substantial differences in drought responses between the genotypes, both at the phenotypic and transcriptional levels. In addition to the genotypic variation in several traits, we also found indications for genotypic variation in trait plasticity, which could play a role in drought adaptation. Furthermore, the two genotypes displayed overall similar transcriptional responses in the root tips, but more variation in the leaves. It is thus possible that the observed phenotypic differences could be a result of transcriptional differences mostly at the leaf level.\n\nThis study has contributed to a better general understanding of drought responses in woody plants, specifically in willows, and has implications for breeding research towards more drought adapted plants.", "doi": "10.1186/s12870-015-0630-2", "pmid": "26458893", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12870-015-0630-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4604075"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d48c07aa694f486e8ec2d3a5fa654d3e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d48c07aa694f486e8ec2d3a5fa654d3e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c0b4fae5cdfe440b97083534b9cb807a", "title": "Evaluation of whole-genome sequencing of four Chinese crested dogs for variant detection using the ion proton system.", "authors": [{"family": "Viluma", "given": "Agnese", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sayyab", "given": "Shumaila", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mikko", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "given": "Tomas F", "initials": "TF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-08", "journal": {"volume": "2", "issn": "2052-6687", "issue": null, "pages": "16", "title": "Canine Genet Epidemiol"}, "abstract": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) has traditionally been performed by large genome centers, but in recent years, the costs for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have decreased substantially.

For each of the four dogs, a 200\u00a0bp fragment library was constructed from genomic DNA and sequenced on two Ion PI chips per dog to reach mean coverage of 6-8x of the canine genome (genome size\u2009\u2248\u20092.4 Gb).\n\nOn average, each Ion PI chip yielded approximately 73.3 million reads with a mean read length of 130\u00a0bp (~9.5 Gb sequence data) of which 98.5\u00a0% could be aligned to the canine reference genome (CanFam3.1). By sequencing a single dog using one fragment library and two Ion PI chips, on average 80\u00a0% of the genome and 77\u00a0% exome was covered by at least four reads. After removing duplicate reads (20.7\u00a0%) the mean coverage across the whole genome was 6x. Using sequence data from all four individuals (four fragment libraries and eight Ion PI chips) the genome and exome coverage could be further increased to 97.2 and 94.3\u00a0%, respectively. We detected 4.83 million unique SNPs and 6.10 million unique INDEL positions across all individuals.

Recent evidence points to the epigenetic and chromatin states of the genome as having important roles.\n\nWe genotyped 355 healthy young individuals for 52 known obesity-associated SNPs and obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category, and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n\u2009=\u200962; four brain regions, n\u2009=\u2009121-133) and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n\u2009=\u2009149).\n\nWe found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1, NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5, SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1, SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27).

Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.\n\nOur results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation.

Here, we confirm candidate, genome-wide distributed selective sweeps originating from the standing genetic variation in a long-term selection experiment on high and low body weight of chickens.\n\nUsing an intercross between the two divergent chicken lines, 16 adaptive selective sweeps were confirmed based on their association with the body weight at 56 days of age. Although individual additive effects were small, the fixation for alternative alleles across the loci contributed at least 40 % of the phenotypic difference for the selected trait between these lines. The sweeps contributed about half of the additive genetic variance present within and between the lines after 40 generations of selection, corresponding to a considerable portion of the additive genetic variance of the base population.\n\nLong-term, single-trait, bi-directional selection in the Virginia chicken lines has resulted in a gradual response to selection for extreme phenotypes without a drastic reduction in the genetic variation.

All iPSC lines fulfilled stringent criteria for pluripotency. In an unbiased cluster analysis, all stem cell lines (four iPSCs and one ESC) clustered together as opposed to the parental fibroblasts. The transcriptome profiles of the three iPSC sister lines were indistinguishable from each other, and functional pathway analysis did not reveal any significant hits. In contrast, the expression profiles of the ESC line and the iPSC-K5B line were distinct from that of the sister lines iPSC-K1A, B, and C. Differentiation to embryoid bodies and subsequent analysis of germ layer markers in the five stem cell clones confirmed that the distribution of their expression profiles was retained. Taken together, our observations stress the importance of using iPSCs of different parental origin rather than several sister iPSC lines to distinguish disease-associated mechanisms from genetic background effects in disease modeling.", "doi": "10.1089/cell.2015.0009", "pmid": "26348590", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0251a2b4aed046f19b1bcc4ff2c51ccc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0251a2b4aed046f19b1bcc4ff2c51ccc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "09c7bf7c85b047d8826f42078f26944c", "title": "Genetic variance estimation with imputed variants finds negligible missing heritability for human height and body mass index.", "authors": [{"family": "Yang", "given": "Jian", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bakshi", "given": "Andrew", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zhu", "given": "Zhihong", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Hemani", "given": "Gibran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Vinkhuyzen", "given": "Anna A E", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "Sang Hong", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Robinson", "given": "Matthew R", "initials": "MR"}, {"family": "Perry", "given": "John R B", "initials": "JR"}, {"family": "Nolte", "given": "Ilja M", "initials": "IM"}, {"family": "van Vliet-Ostaptchouk", "given": "Jana V", "initials": "JV"}, {"family": "Snieder", "given": "Harold", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "LifeLines Cohort Study", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Esko", "given": "Tonu", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Milani", "given": "Lili", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "M\u00e4gi", "given": "Reedik", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Metspalu", "given": "Andres", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Patrik K E", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Nancy L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Ingelsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Soranzo", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Keller", "given": "Matthew C", "initials": "MC"}, {"family": "Wray", "given": "Naomi R", "initials": "NR"}, {"family": "Goddard", "given": "Michael E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Visscher", "given": "Peter M", "initials": "PM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "47", "issn": "1546-1718", "issue": "10", "pages": "1114-1120", "title": "Nat.

Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all \u223c17 million imputed variants explain 56% (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3%) of variance for height and 27% (s.e. = 2.5%) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70% for height and 30-40% for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits.

We studied 282 females with SBC, focusing on copy number aberrations in cancer-free breast tissue (uninvolved margin, UM) outside the primary tumor (PT). In total, 1162 UMs (1-14 per breast) were studied. Comparative analysis between UM(s), PT(s), and blood/skin from the same patient as a control is the core of the study design. We identified 108 patients with at least one aberrant UM, representing 38.3% of cases. Gains in gene copy number were the principal type of mutations in microscopically normal breast cells, suggesting that oncogenic activation of genes via increased gene copy number is a predominant mechanism for initiation of SBC pathogenesis. The gain of ERBB2, with overexpression of HER2 protein, was the most common aberration in normal cells. Five additional growth factor receptor genes (EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1R, LIFR, and NGFR) also showed recurrent gains, and these were occasionally present in combination with the gain of ERBB2. All the aberrations found in the normal breast cells were previously described in cancer literature, suggesting their causative, driving role in pathogenesis of SBC. We demonstrate that analysis of normal cells from cancer patients leads to identification of signatures that may increase risk of SBC and our results could influence the choice of surgical intervention to remove all predisposing cells.

This approach unveiled major differences, both in functional and molecular terms, in response to single versus repeated-dose exposures to simvastatin. The main functional effect of the in vitro simvastatin-induced long-term toxicity was a loss of proliferative capacity in the absence of concomitant cell death, revealing that cytostatic effect could be a major contributor to statin-induced myotoxicity. Comparative analysis of molecular modifications induced by simvastatin short-term versus prolonged exposures demonstrated powerful adaptive cell responses, as illustrated by the dramatic decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes, distinct biological pathway enrichments, and distinct patterns of nutrient transporters expressed at the cell surface.

Even when it occurs, compensation can be incomplete and limited to dosage-sensitive genes. However, previous work has mainly studied transcriptional regulation of sex-linked genes, which may not reflect expression at the protein level. Here, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect and quantify expressed levels of more than 2,400 proteins in ten different tissues of male and female chicken embryos. For comparison, transcriptome sequencing was performed in the same individuals, five of each sex. The proteomic analysis revealed that dosage compensation was incomplete, with a mean male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of Z-linked genes of 1.32 across tissues, similar to that at the RNA level (1.29). The mean Z chromosome-to-autosome expression ratio was close to 1 in males and lower than 1 in females, consistent with partly reduced Z chromosome expression in females. Although our results exclude a general mechanism for chromosome-wide dosage compensation at translation, 30% of all proteins encoded from Z-linked genes showed a significant change in the M:F ratio compared with the corresponding ratio at the RNA level. This resulted in a pattern where some genes showed balanced expression between sexes and some close to 2-fold higher expression in males. This suggests that proteomic analyses will be necessary to reveal a more complete picture of gene regulation and sex chromosome evolution.", "doi": "10.1093/molbev/msv147", "pmid": "26108680",

measure of body shape. Body size and shape change as people grow older and these changes differ substantially between men and women. To systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent) with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and WHRadjBMI in four strata (men \u226450y, men >50y, women \u226450y, women >50y) and summary statistics were combined in stratum-specific meta-analyses. We then screened for variants that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects (G x SEX) or age-specific effects that differed between men and women (G x AGE x SEX). For BMI, we identified 15 loci (11 previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed significant (FDR<5%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had larger effects in younger (<50y) than in older adults (\u226550y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI. For WHRadjBMI, we identified 44 loci (27 previously established for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which 28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified for WHRadjBMI. This is the first genome-wide interaction meta-analysis to report convincing evidence of age-dependent genetic effects on BMI. In addition, we confirm the sex-specificity of genetic effects on WHRadjBMI.

The mammalian MAPEG family consists of six members where four have been structurally determined. MGST2 activates glutathione to form a thiolate that is crucial for GSH peroxidase activity and GSH conjugation reactions with electrophilic substrates, such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Several studies have shown that MGST2 is able to catalyze a GSH conjugation reaction with the epoxide LTA4 forming the pro-inflammatory LTC4. Unlike its closest homologue leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), MGST2 appears to activate its substrate GSH using only one of the three potential active sites [Ahmad S, et al. (2013) Biochemistry. 52, 1755-1764]. In order to demonstrate and detail the mechanism of one-third of the sites reactivity of MGST2, we have determined the enzyme oligomeric state, by Blue native PAGE and Differential Scanning Calorimetry, as well as the stoichiometry of substrate and substrate analog inhibitor binding to MGST2, using equilibrium dialysis and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, respectively. Global simulations were used to fit kinetic data to determine the catalytic mechanism of MGST2 with GSH and CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) as substrates. The best fit was observed with 1/3 of the sites catalysis as compared with a simulation where all three sites were active. In contrast to LTC4S, MGST2 displays a 1/3 the sites reactivity, a mechanism shared with the more distant family member MGST1 and recently suggested also for microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbapap.2015.06.003", "pmid": "26066610", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1570-9639(15)00169-7"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/53e1d8e81eed49af8521e5c3d8db3053.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/53e1d8e81eed49af8521e5c3d8db3053"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "58a4444450884ccaa2cd140ffed4f2cc", "title": "A New Method for Detecting Associations with Rare Copy-Number Variants.", "authors": [{"family": "Tzeng", "given": "Jung-Ying", "initials": "JY"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Patrik K E", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Sullivan", "given": "Patrick F", "initials": "PF"}, {"family": "Swedish Schizophrenia Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Szatkiewicz", "given": "Jin P", "initials": "JP"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "10", "pages": "e1005403", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) play an important role in the etiology of many diseases such as cancers and psychiatric disorders. Due to a modest marginal effect size or the rarity of the CNVs, collapsing rare CNVs together and collectively evaluating their effect serves as a key approach to evaluating the collective effect of rare CNVs on disease risk. While a plethora of powerful collapsing methods are available for sequence variants (e.g., SNPs) in association analysis, these methods cannot be directly applied to rare CNVs due to the CNV-specific challenges, i.e., the multi-faceted nature of CNV polymorphisms (e.g., CNVs vary in size, type, dosage, and details of gene disruption), and etiological heterogeneity (e.g., heterogeneous effects of duplications and deletions that occur within a locus or in different loci). Existing CNV collapsing analysis methods (a.k.a. the burden test) tend to have suboptimal performance due to the fact that these methods often ignore heterogeneity and evaluate only the marginal effects of a CNV feature. We introduce CCRET, a random effects test for collapsing rare CNVs when searching for disease associations. CCRET is applicable to variants measured on a multi-categorical scale, collectively modeling the effects of multiple CNV features, and is robust to etiological heterogeneity. Multiple confounders can be simultaneously corrected. To evaluate the performance of CCRET, we conducted extensive simulations and analyzed large-scale schizophrenia datasets. We show that CCRET has powerful and robust performance under multiple types of etiological heterogeneity, and has performance comparable to or better than existing methods when there is no heterogeneity.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1005403", "pmid": "26431523", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PGENETICS-D-15-00206"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4592002"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/58a4444450884ccaa2cd140ffed4f2cc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/58a4444450884ccaa2cd140ffed4f2cc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "705f119ca5e245319a1d217015cc90cf", "title": "Positive Modulation of the Glycine Receptor by Means of Glycine Receptor\u2013Binding Aptamers", "authors": [{"family": "Shalaly", "given": "Nancy Dekki", "initials": "ND"}, {"family": "Aneiros", "given": "Eduardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Blank", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mueller", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nyman", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Blind", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Dabrowski", "given": "Michael A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Christin V", "initials": "CV"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Kristian", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "20", "issn": "1552-454X", "issue": "9", "pages": "1112-1123", "title": "J Biomol Screen"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1177/1087057115590575", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Drug Discovery and Development (DDD)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/705f119ca5e245319a1d217015cc90cf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/705f119ca5e245319a1d217015cc90cf"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "77b6751cea9a473eb0727789d2526d87", "title": "Cis-Regulatory Changes Associated with a Recent Mating System Shift and Floral Adaptation in Capsella.", "authors": [{"family": "Steige", "given": "Kim A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Reimeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Koenig", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Scofield", "given": "Douglas G", "initials": "DG"}, {"family": "Slotte", "given": "Tanja", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "32", "issn": "1537-1719", "issue": "10", "pages": "2501-2514", "title": "Mol.

Here, we investigate the role of cis-regulatory changes during the recent evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella rubella, which split from the outcrosser Capsella grandiflora less than 200 ka. We assess allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaves and flower buds at a total of 18,452 genes in three interspecific F1 C. grandiflora x C. rubella hybrids. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that accounts for technical variation using genomic reads, we find evidence for extensive cis-regulatory changes. On average, 44% of the assayed genes show evidence of ASE; however, only 6% show strong allelic expression biases. Flower buds, but not leaves, show an enrichment of cis-regulatory changes in genomic regions responsible for floral and reproductive trait divergence between C. rubella and C. grandiflora. We further detected an excess of heterozygous transposable element (TE) insertions near genes with ASE, and TE insertions targeted by uniquely mapping 24-nt small RNAs were associated with reduced expression of nearby genes. Our results suggest that cis-regulatory changes have been important during the recent adaptive floral evolution in Capsella and that differences in TE dynamics between selfing and outcrossing species could be important for rapid regulatory divergence in association with mating system shifts.", "doi": "10.1093/molbev/msv169", "pmid": "26318184", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "msv169"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4576713"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/77b6751cea9a473eb0727789d2526d87.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/77b6751cea9a473eb0727789d2526d87"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "982dd1cdc3434cd8b71078d29f9a0a97", "title": "BCG Skin Infection Triggers IL-1R-MyD88-Dependent Migration of EpCAMlow CD11bhigh Skin Dendritic cells to Draining Lymph Node During CD4+ T-Cell Priming.", "authors": [{"family": "Bollampalli", "given": "Vishnu Priya", "initials": "VP"}, {"family": "Harumi Yamashiro", "given": "L\u00edvia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Feng", "given": "Xiaogang", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Bierschenk", "given": "Dami\u00ebn", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gao", "given": "Yu", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Blom", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Henriques-Normark", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Nyl\u00e9n", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rothfuchs", "given": "Antonio Gigliotti", "initials": "AG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1553-7374", "issue": "10", "pages": "e1005206", "title": "PLoS Pathog."}, "abstract": "The transport of antigen from the periphery to the draining lymph node (DLN) is critical for T-cell priming but remains poorly studied during infection with Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). To address this we employed a mouse model to track the traffic of Dendritic cells (DCs) and mycobacteria from the BCG inoculation site in the skin to the DLN. Detection of BCG in the DLN was concomitant with the priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at that site. We found EpCAMlow CD11bhigh migratory skin DCs to be mobilized during the transport of BCG to the DLN. Migratory skin DCs distributed to the T-cell area of the LN, co-localized with BCG and were found in close apposition to antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Consequently, blockade of skin DC traffic into DLN dramatically reduced mycobacterial entry into DLN and muted T-cell priming. Interestingly, DC and mycobacterial entry into the DLN was dependent on IL-1R-I, MyD88, TNFR-I and IL-12p40. In addition, we found using DC adoptive transfers that the requirement for MyD88 in BCG-triggered migration was not restricted to the migrating DC itself and that hematopoietic expression of MyD88 was needed in part for full-fledged migration. Our observations thus identify a population of DCs that contribute towards the priming of CD4+ T cells to BCG infection by transporting bacilli into the DLN in an IL-1R-MyD88-dependent manner and reveal both DC-intrinsic and -extrinsic requirements for MyD88 in DC migration.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1005206", "pmid": "26440518", "labels": {"Advanced Light Microscopy (ALM)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PPATHOGENS-D-15-00825"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4594926"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/982dd1cdc3434cd8b71078d29f9a0a97.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/982dd1cdc3434cd8b71078d29f9a0a97"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b3aec05208c24c8cbae93d8ea7c982c5", "title": "The effects of age and gender on plasma levels of 63 cytokines", "authors": [{"family": "Larsson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Carlsson", "given": "Lena", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gordh", "given": "Torsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lind", "given": "Anne Li", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Thulin", "given": "M\u00e5ns", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kamali-Moghaddam", "given": "Masood", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "425", "issn": "0022-1759", "issue": null, "pages": "58-61", "title": "Journal of Immunological Methods"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jim.2015.06.009", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Clinical Biomarkers": "Service", "PLA Proteomics": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b3aec05208c24c8cbae93d8ea7c982c5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b3aec05208c24c8cbae93d8ea7c982c5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b7471af7523142ec8e6284d21fb6277c", "title": "Isolation of novel IncA/C and IncN fluoroquinolone resistance plasmids from an antibiotic-polluted lake.", "authors": [{"family": "Flach", "given": "Carl-Fredrik", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Johnning", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Ida", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Smalla", "given": "Kornelia", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Kristiansson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "D G Joakim", "initials": "DG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "70", "issn": "1460-2091", "issue": "10", "pages": "2709-2717", "title": "J.

Here, the first report on antibacterial properties of six dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans found in Schisandra spp. is presented. The activity was shown on two related intracellular Gram-negative bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis upon their infection in human epithelial cells. All six lignans inhibited C. pneumoniae inclusion formation and infectious progeny production. Schisandrin B inhibited C. pneumoniae inclusion formation even when administered 8\u2009h post infection, indicating a target that occurs relatively late within the infection cycle. Upon infection, lignan-pretreated C. pneumoniae elementary bodies had impaired inclusion formation capacity. The presence and substitution pattern of methylenedioxy, methoxy and hydroxyl groups of the lignans had a profound impact on the antichlamydial activity. In addition our data suggest that the antichlamydial activity is not caused only by the antioxidative properties of the lignans. None of the compounds showed inhibition on seven other bacteria, suggesting a degree of selectivity of the antibacterial effect. Taken together, the data presented support a role of the studied lignans as interesting antichlamydial lead compounds.", "doi": "10.1038/ja.2015.48", "pmid": "25944533", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ja201548"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d510054e921e4456aea66a41ead6a7ec.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d510054e921e4456aea66a41ead6a7ec"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ddeb8ed71db84e7ca42ea51082686059", "title": "Profound parental bias associated with chromosome 14 acquired uniparental disomy indicates targeting of an imprinted locus.", "authors": [{"family": "Chase", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Leung", "given": "W", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Tapper", "given": "W", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Jones", "given": "A V", "initials": "AV"}, {"family": "Knoops", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rasi", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Forsberg", "given": "L A", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Guglielmelli", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Zoi", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Hall", "given": "V", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Chiecchio", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Eder-Azanza", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bryant", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lannfelt", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Docherty", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "White", "given": "H E", "initials": "HE"}, {"family": "Score", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mackay", "given": "D J G", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Vannucchi", "given": "A M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Dumanski", "given": "J P", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Cross", "given": "N C P", "initials": "NC"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "29", "issn": "1476-5551", "issue": "10", "pages": "2069-2074", "title": "Leukemia"}, "abstract": "Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a common finding in myeloid malignancies and typically acts to convert a somatically acquired heterozygous mutation to homozygosity.

We identified 29 cases with aUPD14q that defined a minimal affected region (MAR) of 11.2\u2009Mb running from 14q32.12 to the telomere. Exome sequencing (n=7) did not identify recurrently mutated genes, but methylation-specific PCR at the imprinted MEG3-DLK1 locus located within the MAR demonstrated loss of maternal chromosome 14 and gain of paternal chromosome 14 (P<0.0001), with the degree of methylation imbalance correlating with the level of aUPD (r=0.76; P=0.0001). The absence of driver gene mutations in the exomes of three individuals with aUPD14q but no known haematological disorder suggests that aUPD14q may be sufficient to drive clonal haemopoiesis. Analysis of cases with both aUPD14q and JAK2 V617F (n=11) indicated that aUPD14q may be an early event in some cases but a late event in others.

The aim of this work was identification of potential diagnostic biomarkers for characterization of different types of prostate tumors. NotI-microarrays with 180 clones associated with chromosome 3 genes/loci were applied to determine genetic and epigenetic alterations in 33 prostate tumors. For 88 clones, aberrations were detected in more than 10% of tumors. The major types of alterations were DNA methylation and/or deletions. Frequent methylation of the discovered loci was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing on selective sampling of genes: FGF12, GATA2, and LMCD1.

A highly effective, live, multi-isolate vaccine against T. parva exists, but its component isolates have not been characterized.

The 420 detectable non-synonymous SNPs were distributed among only 53 genes, primarily subtelomeric antigens and antigenic families. The Kiambu5 isolate is considerably more divergent, with close to 40,000 SNPs relative to Muguga, including >8,500 non-synonymous mutations distributed among >1,700 (42.5 %) of the predicted genes. These genetic markers of the component stocks can be used to characterize the composition of new batches of the Muguga Cocktail.\n\nDifferences among these three isolates, while extensive, represent only a small proportion of the genetic variation in the entire species.

We present, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide sequence data from eight human remains, dated to between 5,500 and 3,500 years before present, excavated in the El Portal\u00f3n cave at Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain. We show that these individuals emerged from the same ancestral gene pool as early farmers in other parts of Europe, suggesting that migration was the dominant mode of transferring farming practices throughout western Eurasia. In contrast to central and northern early European farmers, the Chalcolithic El Portal\u00f3n individuals additionally mixed with local southwestern hunter-gatherers. The proportion of hunter-gatherer-related admixture into early farmers also increased over the course of two millennia. The Chalcolithic El Portal\u00f3n individuals showed greatest genetic affinity to modern-day Basques, who have long been considered linguistic and genetic isolates linked to the Mesolithic whereas all other European early farmers show greater genetic similarity to modern-day Sardinians. These genetic links suggest that Basques and their language may be linked with the spread of agriculture during the Neolithic. Furthermore, all modern-day Iberian groups except the Basques display distinct admixture with Caucasus/Central Asian and North African groups, possibly related to historical migration events.

Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription. PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina therefore mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.019", "pmid": "26321255", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1097-2765(15)00577-8"}, {"db": "GEO", "key": "GSE26880"}, {"db": "GEO", "key": "GSE58534"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc1955ed9ae2463f8a8d503bd7ab63cb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc1955ed9ae2463f8a8d503bd7ab63cb"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f6d9330dc7e94358a4219441a106771d", "title": "Genetic and morphological evidence for introgression between three species of willows.", "authors": [{"family": "Fogelqvist", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Verkhozina", "given": "Alla V", "initials": "AV"}, {"family": "Katyshev", "given": "Alexander I", "initials": "AI"}, {"family": "Pucholt", "given": "Pascal", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Dixelius", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nnberg-W\u00e4stljung", "given": "Ann Christin", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Lascoux", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Berlin", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-09-16", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1471-2148", "issue": null, "pages": "193", "title": "BMC Evol.

However, data on the actual frequency of natural hybridization and introgression is rare. Here, we report the first fine-scale genetic analysis of a contact zone shared between the three basket willow species, Salix dasyclados, S. schwerinii and S. viminalis in the vicinity of the Lake Baikal in Southern Siberia. Individuals were sampled in fourteen populations and classified as pure species or hybrids based on a set of morphological characters. They were then genotyped at 384 nuclear SNP and four chloroplast SSR loci. The STRUCTURE and NewHybrids softwares were used to estimate the frequency and direction of hybridization using genotypic data at the nuclear SNP loci.\n\nAs many as 19 % of the genotyped individuals were classified as introgressed individuals and these were mainly encountered in the centre of the contact zone. All introgressed individuals were backcrosses to S. viminalis or S. schwerinii and no F1 or F2 hybrids were found. The rest of the genotyped individuals were classified as pure species and formed two clusters, one with S. schwerinii individuals and the other with S. viminalis and S. dasyclados individuals. The two clusters were significantly genetically differentiated, with F ST = 0.333 (0.282-0.382, p < 0.001). In contrast, for the chloroplast haplotypes, no genetic differentiation was observed as they were completely shared between the species. Based on morphological classification only 5 % of the individuals were classified as introgressed individuals, which was much less than what was detected using genotypic data.\n\nWe have discovered a new willow hybrid zone with relatively high frequency of introgressed individuals. The low frequency of F1 hybrids indicates that ongoing hybridization is limited, which could be because of the presence of reproductive barriers or simply because the conditions are not favorable for hybridization. We further conclude that in order to get a complete picture of the species composition of a hybrid zone it is necessary to use a combination of morphological characters and genetic data from both nuclear and chloroplast markers.", "doi": "10.1186/s12862-015-0461-7", "pmid": "26376815", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12862-015-0461-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4574262"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6d9330dc7e94358a4219441a106771d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6d9330dc7e94358a4219441a106771d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4938fa914f2649f2a97184529000b0c2", "title": "Comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression in regionalized human neural progenitor cells reveals microRNA-10 as a caudalizing factor.", "authors": [{"family": "J\u00f6nsson", "given": "Marie E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Nelander Wahlestedt", "given": "Jenny", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "\u00c5kerblom", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kirkeby", "given": "Agnete", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Malmevik", "given": "Josephine", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Brattaas", "given": "Per Ludvik", "initials": "PL"}, {"family": "Jakobsson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Parmar", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-09-15", "journal": {"volume": "142", "issn": "1477-9129", "issue": "18", "pages": "3166-3177", "title": "Development"}, "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating multiple processes during brain development in various species.

In total 13 variants were identified in WNT3, WNT6, WNT7A, WNT8B, WNT10A, WNT11, WNT16, FZD5, LRP1 and LRP10 genes and predicted as potentially disease causing, of which seven variants were novel. One variant, identified in a patient with a de novo nonsynonymous substitution in WNT3 (p.Cys91Arg), was further evaluated in zebrafish. Knock down of wnt3 in zebrafish showed cloaca malformations, including disorganization of the cloaca epithelium and expansion of the cloaca lumen. Our study suggests that the function of the WNT3 p.Cys91Arg variant was altered, since RNA overexpression of mutant Wnt3 RNA does not result in embryonic lethality as seen with wild-type WNT3 mRNA. Finally, we also mutation screened the WNT3 gene further in 410 DNA samples from BEEC cases and identified one additional mutation c.638G>A (p.Gly213Asp), which was paternally inherited.

Willebrand factor (vWF) play key roles in hemostasis.

The aim of this study was to identify low-frequency (minor allele frequency [MAF] \u22650.01 and <0.05) and rare (MAF <0.01) variants that influence plasma concentrations of these 4 hemostatic factors by meta-analyzing exome chip data from up to 76,000 participants of 4 ancestries. We identified 12 novel associations of low-frequency (n = 2) and rare (n = 10) variants across the fibrinogen, FVII, FVIII, and vWF traits that were independent of previously identified associations. Novel loci were found within previously reported genes and had effect sizes much larger than and independent of previously identified common variants. In addition, associations at KCNT1, HID1, and KATNB1 identified new candidate genes related to hemostasis for follow-up replication and functional genomic analysis. Newly identified low-frequency and rare-variant associations accounted for modest amounts of trait variance and therefore are unlikely to increase predicted trait heritability but provide new information for understanding individual variation in hemostasis pathways.", "doi": "10.1182/blood-2015-02-624551", "pmid": "26105150", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "blood-2015-02-624551"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4566813"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2be8707d9ca54be58450aee3de6d9bcb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2be8707d9ca54be58450aee3de6d9bcb"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c2ae0c5d90cb4ae8a5b7fa35de8610e1", "title": "The epigenetic signature of subcutaneous fat cells is linked to altered expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism in obese women.", "authors": [{"family": "Arner", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Sinha", "given": "Indranil", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Thorell", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ryd\u00e9n", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Dahlman-Wright", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dahlman", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-09-08", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1868-7075", "issue": null, "pages": "93", "title": "Clin Epigenetics"}, "abstract": "Obesity is associated with changes in fat cell gene expression and metabolism.

Global array-based transcriptome analysis was analyzed for subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) from 11 obese and 9 never-obese women. Limma was used for statistical analysis.\n\nWe identified 5529 differentially methylated DNA sites (DMS) for 2223 differentially expressed genes between obese cases and never-obese controls (false discovery rate <5\u00a0%). The 5529 DMS displayed a median difference in beta value of 0.09 (range 0.01 to 0.40) between groups. DMS were under-represented in CpG islands and in promoter regions, and over-represented in open sea-regions and gene bodies.

By combining hair cortisol measurements (a well-documented biomarker for chronic stress), with whole-genome DNA-methylation sequencing, we show that high cortisol associates with a genome-wide decrease in DNA methylation and targets short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs; a type of retrotransposon) and genes important for calcium transport: phenomena commonly affected in stress-related diseases and in biological aging. More importantly, we identify a zinc-finger transcription factor, ZNF263, whose binding sites where highly overrepresented in regions experiencing methylation loss. This type of zinc-finger protein has previously shown to be involved in the defense against retrotransposons.\n\nOur results show that stress in preschool children leads to changes in DNA methylation similar to those seen in biological aging. We suggest that this may affect future disease susceptibility by alterations in the epigenetic mechanisms that keep retrotransposons dormant.

We investigated the contribution of P. aeruginosa QS genes lasI/rhlI to phagocytosis, cell morphology, AQP9 expression, and distribution in human macrophages, using immunoblotting, confocal, and nanoscale imaging. Wild type P. aeruginosa with a functional QS system was a more attractive prey for macrophages than the lasI/rhlI mutant lacking the production of QS molecules, 3O-C12-HSL, and C4-HSL, and associated virulence factors. The P. aeruginosa infections resulted in elevated AQP9 expression and relocalization to the leading and trailing regions in macrophages, increased cell area and length; bacteria with a functional QS system lasI/rhlI achieved stronger responses. We present evidence for a new role of water fluxes via AQP9 during bacteria-macrophage interaction and for the QS system as an important stimulus in this process. These novel events in the interplay between P. aeruginosa and macrophages may influence on the outcome of infection, inflammation, and development of disease.", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2015.00915", "pmid": "26388857", "labels": {"Advanced Light Microscopy (ALM)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4558532"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8fdeb19fd9c2433d9eacbb50c9d71b05.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8fdeb19fd9c2433d9eacbb50c9d71b05"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a037290156c84ac98879f71cfffcfeab", "title": "Mutations in SLC12A5 in epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures.", "authors": [{"family": "St\u00f6dberg", "given": "Tommy", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "McTague", "given": "Amy", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ruiz", "given": "Arnaud J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Hirata", "given": "Hiromi", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zhen", "given": "Juan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Long", "given": "Philip", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Farabella", "given": "Irene", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Meyer", "given": "Esther", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kawahara", "given": "Atsuo", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vassallo", "given": "Grace", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Stivaros", "given": "Stavros M", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Bjursell", "given": "Magnus K", "initials": "MK"}, {"family": "Stranneheim", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Tigerschi\u00f6ld", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Bangash", "given": "Iftikhar", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Das", "given": "Krishna", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Hughes", "given": "Deborah", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lesko", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Scott", "given": "Rod C", "initials": "RC"}, {"family": "Poduri", "given": "Annapurna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Scheffer", "given": "Ingrid E", "initials": "IE"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Holly", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gissen", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Schorge", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Reith", "given": "Maarten E A", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Topf", "given": "Maya", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kullmann", "given": "Dimitri M", "initials": "DM"}, {"family": "Harvey", "given": "Robert J", "initials": "RJ"}, {"family": "Wedell", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kurian", "given": "Manju A", "initials": "MA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-09-03", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2041-1723", "issue": null, "pages": "8038", "title": "Nat Commun"}, "abstract": "The potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2, encoded by SLC12A5, plays a fundamental role in fast synaptic inhibition by maintaining a hyperpolarizing gradient for chloride ions.

Heterodimers comprising distinctly tagged wild-type and inactive mutant subunits were purified at 1:1 stoichiometry. Despite having only one-half the number of active sites, purified heterodimers exhibit equivalent activity to wild-type homodimers, consistent with half-of-the-sites reactivity. However, because multiple rounds of turnover were observed, we conclude that substrate binding to one subunit is not required to facilitate product release from the second subunit. The observed half-of-the-sites reactivity could potentially buffer desaturase activity from oxidative inactivation.

In this study, we shed light on the molecular elements regulating regional pigment production in two genetically near-identical crow taxa with striking differences in a eumelanin-based phenotype: black carrion and grey-coated hooded crows. We produced a high-quality genome annotation and analysed transcriptome data from a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 design of active melanogenic feather follicles from head (black in both taxa) and torso (black in carrion and grey in hooded crow). Extensive, parallel expression differences between body regions in both taxa, enriched for melanogenesis genes (e.g. ASIP, CORIN, and ALDH6), indicated the presence of cryptic prepatterning also in all-black carrion crows. Meanwhile, colour-specific expression (grey vs. black) was limited to a small number of melanogenesis genes in close association with the central transcription factor MITF (most notably HPGDS, NDP and RASGRF1). We conclude that colour pattern differences between the taxa likely result from an interaction between divergence in upstream elements of the melanogenesis pathway and genes that provide an underlying prepattern across the body through positional information.

By using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1034 cervical cancer patients and 3948 controls with 632668 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated that 24.0% [standard error (SE) = 5.9%, P = 3.19\u00d710(-6)] of variation in liability to cervical cancer is captured by autosomal SNPs, a bit lower than the heritability estimated from family study (27.0%), suggesting that a substantial proportion of the heritability is tagged by common SNPs. The remaining missing heritability most probably reflects incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and the genotyped SNPs. The variance explained by each chromosome is not related to its length (R (2) = 0.020, P = 0.516). Published genome-wide significant variants only explain 2.1% (SE = 1.5%, P = 0) of phenotypic variance, which reveals that most of the heritability has not been detected, presumably due to small individual effects. Another 2.1% (SE = 1.1%, P = 0.013) of variation is attributable to biological pathways associated with risk of cervical cancer, supporting that pathway analysis can identify part of the hidden heritability. Except for human leukocyte antigen genes and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), none of the 82 candidate genes/regions reported in other association studies contributes to the heritability of cervical cancer in our dataset. This study shows that risk of cervical cancer is influenced by many common germline genetic variants of small effects.

The relevance of these findings for the development and shaping of ADHD symptoms needs to be approached in larger samples, preferably also taking stress reactivity into consideration.", "doi": "10.1111/apa.13056", "pmid": "26032970", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f8ad22abb7e2487282f111a02858dc38.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f8ad22abb7e2487282f111a02858dc38"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fe4b514f9ac0418ab26e270cd972d4f5", "title": "Altered serotonin (5-HT) 1D and 2A receptor expression may contribute to defective insulin and glucagon secretion in human type 2 diabetes.", "authors": [{"family": "Bennet", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Balhuizen", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Medina", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dekker Nitert", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ottosson Laakso", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ess\u00e9n", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Sp\u00e9gel", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Storm", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Krus", "given": "U", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Wierup", "given": "N", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Fex", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-09-00", "journal": {"volume": "71", "issn": "1873-5169", "issue": null, "pages": "113-120", "title": "Peptides"}, "abstract": "Islet produced 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT) is suggested to regulate islet hormone secretion in a paracrine and autocrine manner in rodents.

To clarify this, we performed a complete transcriptional mapping of 5-HT receptors and processing enzymes in human islets and investigated differential expression of these genes in non-diabetic and T2D human islet donors. We show the expression of fourteen 5-HT receptors as well as processing enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 5-HT at the mRNA level in human islets. Two 5-HT receptors (HTR1D and HTR2A) were over-expressed in T2D islet donors.

In islets isolated from T2D donors the amine significantly increased release of insulin in response to glucose.

To understand the functional response of this pathogen to different bacteria and to elucidate whether the molecular mechanisms that the fungus exploits involve general stress or more specific responses, we performed a global transcriptome profiling of R. solani Rhs1AP anastomosis group 3 (AG-3) during interaction with the S4 and AS13 species of Serratia using RNA-seq.\n\nApproximately 104,504 million clean 75-100 bp paired-end reads were obtained from three libraries, each in triplicate (AG3-Control, AG3-S4 and AG3-AS13). Transcriptome analysis revealed that approximately 10% of the fungal transcriptome was differentially expressed during challenge with Serratia. The numbers of S4- and AS13-specific differentially expressed genes (DEG) were 866 and 292 respectively, while there were 1035 common DEGs in the two treatment groups.

A person-centered approach focusing on the interaction of an individual's temperament-character-life events is essential in the path of individuals' well-being. In this context, three character traits, Self-directedness (e.g., self-acceptance, self-control, goal-directed behavior), Cooperativeness (e.g., social affiliation, social tolerance, empathy and helpfulness) and Self-transcendence (e.g., spiritual acceptance, transpersonal identification), measured using Cloninger's model of personality are suggested to help the individual to regulate and resolve the conflicts derived from her/his temperament combinations as a reaction to life events. However, if character is related to the individual's cognitive ability, then this association might limit any intervention that focuses on character development. We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) to investigate the relationship between personality and cognitive ability. Method. The sample consisted of 370 15-year-old twins (159 girls/211 boys), 192 of whom screen-positive with various types of mental health problems. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to measure personality and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV) to measure intelligence. The relationship was investigated using correlation analyses using random-selected twins from each dyad and separately for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Additional analyses investigated the genetic and environmental effects on personality and cognitive ability in this specific sample. Results. There were no significant correlations between the WISC-IV indices and any of the character traits (i.e., Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence). Persistence was significantly related, if weak, to four WISC-IV indices: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and the Full WISC-IV Scale. Post-hoc cross-twin/cross-trait analyses showed that the Persistence-cognitive ability correlation might depend on common genetic effects. The WISC-IV indices showed a relatively large genetic influence, while earlier findings about the etiology of temperament and character traits using the whole CATSS sample were replicated in this sub-sample of twins. Conclusions. The results indicate that what individuals make of themselves intentionally (i.e., their character) was not associated to intelligence. Persistence, a temperament dimension that measures heritable individual differences in eagerness of effort, ambition, perfectionism, and resistance to discouragement despite frustration and fatigue, was weakly linked to intelligence. Suggesting that, at least during adolescence, interventions targeting character development are not limited by the individual's intelligence.", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.1195", "pmid": "26312186", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1195"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4548492"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc0db9c22f8b482e8c8259499428c17c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc0db9c22f8b482e8c8259499428c17c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9d58f3908ade4e4f9c9db7643ece3ee7", "title": "Complementing tissue characterization by integrating transcriptome profiling from the Human Protein Atlas and from the FANTOM5 consortium.", "authors": [{"family": "Yu", "given": "Nancy Yiu-Lin", "initials": "NY"}, {"family": "Hallstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Fagerberg", "given": "Linn", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Kawaji", "given": "Hideya", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Carninci", "given": "Piero", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Forrest", "given": "Alistair R R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Fantom Consortium", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Hayashizaki", "given": "Yoshihide", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Daub", "given": "Carsten O", "initials": "CO"}], "type": "evaluation studies", "published": "2015-08-18", "journal": {"volume": "43", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "14", "pages": "6787-6798", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "Understanding the normal state of human tissue transcriptome profiles is essential for recognizing tissue disease states and identifying disease markers. Recently, the Human Protein Atlas and the FANTOM5 consortium have each published extensive transcriptome data for human samples using Illumina-sequenced RNA-Seq and Heliscope-sequenced CAGE. Here, we report on the first large-scale complex tissue transcriptome comparison between full-length versus 5'-capped mRNA sequencing data. Overall gene expression correlation was high between the 22 corresponding tissues analyzed (R > 0.8). For genes ubiquitously expressed across all tissues, the two data sets showed high genome-wide correlation (91% agreement), with differences observed for a small number of individual genes indicating the need to update their gene models. Among the identified single-tissue enriched genes, up to 75% showed consensus of 7-fold enrichment in the same tissue in both methods, while another 17% exhibited multiple tissue enrichment and/or high expression variety in the other data set, likely dependent on the cell type proportions included in each tissue sample.

Here we characterized the structure of this element, assessed its abundance across conifers, studied the modes and timing of its amplification, and evaluated the degree of conservation of its extant copies at nucleotide level over distant species. We demonstrated that the element is ancient, abundant, widespread and its paralogous copies are present in the genera Picea, Pinus and Abies as an LTR-RT family. The amplification leading to the extant copies of PARTC occurred over long evolutionary times spanning 10s of MY and mostly took place after the speciation of the conifers analyzed. The level of conservation of PARTC is striking and may be explained by low substitution rates and limited removal mechanisms for LTR-RTs.

Several genetic changes were identified in the evolved Pdc negative strains by genomic DNA sequencing. Among these genetic changes, 4 genes were found to carry point mutations in at least two of the evolved strains: MTH1 encoding a negative regulator of the glucose-sensing signal transduction pathway, HXT2 encoding a hexose transporter, CIT1 encoding a mitochondrial citrate synthase, and RPD3 encoding a histone deacetylase. Reverse engineering of the non-evolved Pdc negative strain through introduction of the MTH1 (81D) allele restored its growth on glucose at a maximum specific rate of 0.053 h(-1) in minimal medium with 2% glucose, and the CIT1 deletion in the reverse engineered strain further increased the maximum specific growth rate to 0.069 h(-1).\n\nIn this study, possible evolving mechanisms of Pdc negative strains on glucose were investigated by genome sequencing and reverse engineering. The non-synonymous mutations in MTH1 alleviated the glucose repression by repressing expression of several hexose transporter genes.

the genomes of 110 small cell lung cancers (SCLC), one of the deadliest human cancers.

Two tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC. We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73\u0394ex2/3. In rare cases, SCLC tumours exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells.

TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 induced miR-132 expression in keratinocytes, and transcriptome analysis of these cells revealed that miR-132 regulates a large number of immune response- and cell cycle-related genes. In keratinocytes, miR-132 decreased the production of chemokines and the capability to attract leukocytes by suppressing the NF-\u03baB pathway. Conversely, miR-132 increased activity of the STAT3 and ERK pathways, thereby promoting keratinocyte growth. Silencing of the miR-132 target heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) phenocopied miR-132 overexpression in keratinocytes. Using mouse and human ex vivo wound models, we found that miR-132 blockade delayed healing, which was accompanied by severe inflammation and deficient keratinocyte proliferation. Together, our results indicate that miR-132 is a critical regulator of skin wound healing that facilitates the transition from the inflammatory to the proliferative phase.", "doi": "10.1172/JCI79052", "pmid": "26121747", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "79052"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4563743"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3c2425947bf54f4cb9b8dd794ea5ec48.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3c2425947bf54f4cb9b8dd794ea5ec48"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7f6daf16367a42c2abaa8ea957e3d8c3", "title": "Genome-wide mapping of promoter-anchored interactions with close to single-enhancer resolution.", "authors": [{"family": "Sahl\u00e9n", "given": "Pelin", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Abdullayev", "given": "Ilgar", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ramsk\u00f6ld", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Matskova", "given": "Liudmila", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rilakovic", "given": "Nemanja", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "L\u00f6tstedt", "given": "Britta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Albert", "given": "Thomas J", "initials": "TJ"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Rickard", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-08-03", "journal": {"volume": "16", "issn": "1474-760X", "issue": null, "pages": "156", "title": "Genome Biol."}, "abstract": "Although the locations of promoters and enhancers have been identified in several cell types, we still have limited information on their connectivity.

This could be because the main statistical variability--the basis of cluster generation--is dominated by genes not associated with the clinical phenotype of interest. Furthermore, a strong prognostic factor might be relevant for a certain subgroup but not for the whole population; thus an analysis of the whole sample may not reveal this prognostic factor. To address these problems we investigate methods to identify and assess clinically interesting subgroups in a heterogeneous population.

In the initial genome-wide scan, we found significant distortion at three linked loci on chromosome Tgu2 and we were able to replicate this finding in each of two follow-up data sets [overall transmission ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.567 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.536-0.600), based on 1101 informative meioses].

Early postzygotic viability selection is unlikely, because it would result in eggs with no visible embryo and hence no opportunity for genotyping, and we confirmed that both females and males heterozygous for the driving allele did not produce a larger proportion of such eggs than homozygous birds. Biased gene conversion is expected to be rather localized, while we could trace transmission distortion in haplotypes of several megabases in a recombination desert.

Arabidopsis lyrata is a predominantly self-incompatible perennial plant, closely related to the selfing model species A. thaliana. To examine how inbreeding affects gene expression, we compared the transcriptome of experimentally selfed and outcrossed A. lyrata originating from two Scandinavian populations that express similar inbreeding depression for fitness (\u2202 \u2248 0.80). The number of genes significantly differentially expressed between selfed and outcrossed individuals were 2.5 times higher in the Norwegian population (\u2248 500 genes) than in the Swedish population (\u2248 200 genes). In both populations, a majority of genes were upregulated on selfing (\u2248 80%). Functional annotation analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that selfed offspring were characterized by 1) upregulation of stress-related genes in both populations and 2) upregulation of photosynthesis-related genes in Sweden but downregulation in Norway. Moreover, we found that reproduction- and pollination-related genes were affected by inbreeding only in Norway. We conclude that inbreeding causes both general and population-specific effects. The observed common effects suggest that inbreeding generally upregulates rather than downregulates gene expression and affects genes associated with stress response and general metabolic activity. Population differences in the number of affected genes and in effects on the expression of photosynthesis-related genes show that the genetic basis of inbreeding depression can differ between populations with very similar levels of inbreeding depression.", "doi": "10.1093/molbev/msv086", "pmid": "25855783", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "msv086"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4833072"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7fb91ebe96624c79b2949d7397a0e3c3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7fb91ebe96624c79b2949d7397a0e3c3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e7b66972d3b1437e8c941bfca6862d43", "title": "Prevalence of polymorphisms with significant resistance to NS5A inhibitors in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a and 3a in Sweden.", "authors": [{"family": "Lindstr\u00f6m", "given": "Ida", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Kjellin", "given": "Midori", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Palanisamy", "given": "Navaneethan", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bondeson", "given": "K\u00e5re", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wessl\u00e9n", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Lannergard", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lennerstrand", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "47", "issn": "2374-4243", "issue": "8", "pages": "555-562", "title": "Infect Dis (Lond)"}, "abstract": "The future treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will be combinations of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that not only target multiple viral targets, but are also effective against different HCV genotypes. Of the many drug targets in HCV, one promising target is the non-structural 5A protein (NS5A), against which inhibitors, namely daclatasvir, ledipasvir and ombitasvir, have shown potent efficacy. However, since HCV is known to have very high sequence diversity, development of resistance is a problem against but not limited to NS5A inhibitors (i.e. resistance also found against NS3-protease and NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors), when used in suboptimal combinations. Furthermore, it has been shown that natural resistance against DAAs is present in treatment-na\u00efve patients and such baseline resistance will potentially complicate future treatment strategies.\n\nA pan-genotypic population-sequencing method with degenerated primers targeting the NS5A region was developed.

In addition to its well-documented cytoplasmic chaperone function, in 2008 Atox1 was suggested to have functionality in the nucleus. To identify new interactions partners of Atox1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a large human placenta library of cDNA fragments using Atox1 as bait. Among 98 million fragments investigated, 25 proteins were found to be confident interaction partners. Nine of these were uncharacterized proteins, and the remaining 16 proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics with respect to cell localization, tissue distribution, function, sequence motifs, three-dimensional structures and interaction networks. Several of the hits were eukaryotic-specific proteins interacting with DNA or RNA implying that Atox1 may act as a modulator of gene regulation.

associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs\u00a0of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 \u00d7 10(-300), 2.1 \u00d7 10(-6), 2.5 \u00d7 10(-10) and 1.8 \u00d7 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.", "doi": "10.1038/nature14618", "pmid": "26131930", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature14618"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4516141"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "EMS63641"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7e87661eaf97436db1f4df8954383769.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7e87661eaf97436db1f4df8954383769"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8a731b002afd4687b02d25ba783fe634", "title": "Compaction of rolling circle amplification products increases signal integrity and signal-to-noise ratio.", "authors": [{"family": "Clausson", "given": "Carl-Magnus", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Arng\u00e5rden", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ishaq", "given": "Omer", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Klaesson", "given": "Axel", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "K\u00fchnemund", "given": "Malte", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Grannas", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Koos", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Qian", "given": "Xiaoyan", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Ranefall", "given": "Petter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Krzywkowski", "given": "Tomasz", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Brismar", "given": "Hjalmar", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "W\u00e4hlby", "given": "Carolina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derberg", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2015-07-23", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "12317", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Rolling circle amplification (RCA) for generation of distinct fluorescent signals in situ relies upon the self-collapsing properties of single-stranded DNA in commonly used RCA-based methods.

The reduced size of RCPs increases the local concentration of fluorophores and as a result, the signal intensity increases together with the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we have found that RCPs sometimes tend to disintegrate and may be recorded as several RCPs, a trait that is prevented with our cross-hybridizing DNA oligonucleotide.

A GWA study for TGCT was performed by genotyping 610 240 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1326 cases and 6687 controls from Sweden and Norway. No novel genome-wide significant associations were observed in this discovery stage. We put forward 27 SNPs from 15 novel regions and 12 SNPs previously reported, for replication in 710 case-parent triads and 289 cases and 290 controls. Predefined biological pathways and processes, in addition to a custom-built sex-determination gene set, were subject to enrichment analyses using Meta-Analysis Gene Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (M) and Improved Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Genome-wide Association Study (I). In the combined meta-analysis, we observed genome-wide significant association for rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-9)) and rs2195987 on chromosome 19p12 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69-0.84, P = 3.2 \u00d7 10(-8)). The marker rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 is located in an intron of the HNF1B gene, encoding a member of the homeodomain-containing superfamily of transcription factors. The sex-determination gene set (false discovery rate, FDRM < 0.001, FDRI < 0.001) and pathways related to NF-\u03baB, glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, as well as cancer and apoptosis, was associated with TGCT (FDR < 0.1).

We previously reported that treatment of stored platelets with the PR system Intercept significantly reduced the level of half of the microRNAs that were monitored, induced platelet activation and compromised the platelet response to physiological agonists. Using genome-wide differential expression (DE) RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we now report that Intercept markedly perturbs the mRNA transcriptome of human platelets and alters the expression level of >800 mRNAs (P<0.05) compared to other PR systems and control platelets. Of these, 400 genes were deregulated with DE corresponding to fold changes (FC) \u2265 2. At the p-value < 0.001, as many as 147 genes were deregulated by \u2265 2-fold in Intercept-treated platelets, compared to none in the other groups. Finally, integrated analysis combining expression data for microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA, and involving prediction of miRNA-mRNA interactions, disclosed several positive and inverse correlations between miRNAs and mRNAs in stored platelets.

The virus appears to be closely linked to varroa, with the highest prevalence found in varroa samples and a clear seasonal distribution peaking in autumn, coinciding with the natural varroa population development.

We used the largest data sets available: 34,840 T2D case and 114,981 control subjects from the DIAGRAM (DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis) consortium and up to 133,010 individuals without diabetes for insulin secretion and sensitivity from the MAGIC (Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium) and GENESIS (GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity) studies. Eight of 21 associations between groups of variants and diabetes traits were significant at the nominal level, including those between genetically determined lower HDL-C (\u03b2 = -0.12, P = 0.03) and T2D and genetically determined lower LDL-C (\u03b2 = -0.21, P = 5 \u00d7 10(-6)) and T2D. Although some of these may represent causal associations, we discuss why caution must be used when using Mendelian randomization in the context of circulating lipid levels and diabetes traits. In conclusion, we found evidence of links between genetic variants associated with lipids and T2D, but deeper knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms of specific lipid variants is needed before drawing definite conclusions about causality based on Mendelian randomization methodology.", "doi": "10.2337/db14-1710", "pmid": "25948681", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "db14-1710"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1a6d54f635cf4edfafd95532941cc38c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1a6d54f635cf4edfafd95532941cc38c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "27eab43d3b414feda1dcd8bc32559aa6", "title": "UV irradiation responses in Giardia intestinalis.", "authors": [{"family": "Einarsson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sv\u00e4rd", "given": "Staffan G", "initials": "SG"}, {"family": "Troell", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "154", "issn": "1090-2449", "issue": null, "pages": "25-32", "title": "Exp.

UV radiation at 10 mJ/cm(2) kills Giardia cysts effectively whereas trophozoites and encysting parasites can recover from UV treatment at 100 mJ/cm(2) and 50 mJ/cm(2) respectively. Staining for phosphorylated histone H2A showed that UV treatment induces double-stranded DNA breaks and flow cytometry analyses revealed that UV treatment of trophozoites induces DNA replication arrest. Active DNA replication coupled to DNA repair could be an explanation to why UV light does not kill trophozoites and encysting cells as efficiently as the non-replicating cysts. We also examined UV-induced gene expression responses in both trophozoites and cysts using RNA sequencing (RNA seq). UV radiation induces small overall changes in gene expression in Giardia but cysts show a stronger response than trophozoites. Heat shock proteins, kinesins and Nek kinases are up-regulated, whereas alpha-giardins and histones are down-regulated in UV treated trophozoites. Expression of variable surface proteins (VSPs) is changed in both trophozoites and cysts.

Within the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) Consortium, we have undertaken the first large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), supplemented by 1000G imputation, for four quantitative glycaemic and obesity-related traits, in up to 87,048 individuals of European ancestry. We identified two loci for body mass index (BMI) at genome-wide significance, and two for fasting glucose (FG), none of which has been previously reported in larger meta-analysis efforts to combine GWAS of European ancestry. Through conditional analysis, we also detected multiple distinct signals of association mapping to established loci for waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (RSPO3) and FG (GCK and G6PC2). The index variant for one association signal at the G6PC2 locus is a low-frequency coding allele, H177Y, which has recently been demonstrated to have a functional role in glucose regulation. Fine-mapping analyses revealed that the non-coding variants most likely to drive association signals at established and novel loci were enriched for overlap with enhancer elements, which for FG mapped to promoter and transcription factor binding sites in pancreatic islets, in particular. Our study demonstrates that 1000G imputation and genetic fine-mapping of common and low-frequency variant association signals at GWAS loci, integrated with genomic annotation in relevant tissues, can provide insight into the functional and regulatory mechanisms through which their effects on glycaemic and obesity-related traits are mediated.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1005230", "pmid": "26132169", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PGENETICS-D-14-03245"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4488845"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3c775fcf5c284daa96d8e11637e62725.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3c775fcf5c284daa96d8e11637e62725"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "594abf1e6c264c7cadce23e3153ac965", "title": "Function of Isolated Pancreatic Islets From Patients at Onset of Type 1 Diabetes: Insulin Secretion Can Be Restored After Some Days in a Nondiabetogenic Environment In Vitro: Results From the DiViD Study.", "authors": [{"family": "Krogvold", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Skog", "given": "Oskar", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "G\u00f6rel", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Edwin", "given": "Bj\u00f8rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Buanes", "given": "Trond", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hanssen", "given": "Kristian F", "initials": "KF"}, {"family": "Ludvigsson", "given": "Johnny", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Grabherr", "given": "Manfred", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Korsgren", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Dahl-J\u00f8rgensen", "given": "Knut", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "64", "issn": "1939-327X", "issue": "7", "pages": "2506-2512", "title": "Diabetes"}, "abstract": "The understanding of the etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains limited.

To date, very little effort has been devoted to the study of the metabolism of PCBs on a genome-wide level.\n\nHere, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions involved in the metabolism of PCBs.\n\nPlasma levels of 16 PCBs ascertained in a cohort of elderly individuals from Sweden (n=1016) were measured using gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrophotometry (GC-HRMS). DNA samples were genotyped on the Infinium Omni Express bead microarray, and imputed up to reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Association testing was performed in a linear regression framework under an additive model.\n\nPlasma levels of PCB-99 demonstrated genome-wide significant association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to chromosome 19q13.2. The SNP with the strongest association was rs8109848 (p=3.7\u00d710(-13)), mapping to an intronic region of CYP2B6. Moreover, when all PCBs were conditioned on PCB-99, further signals were revealed for PCBs -74, -105 and -118, mapping to the same genomic region. The lead SNPs were rs8109848 (p=3.8\u00d710(-12)) for PCB-118, rs4802104 (p=1.4\u00d710(-9)) for PCB-74 and rs4803413 (p=2.5\u00d710(-9)) for PCB-105, all of which map to CYP2B6.\n\nIn our study, we found plasma levels of four lower-chlorinated PCBs to be significantly associated with the genetic region mapping to the CYP2B6 locus.

ST variation and their geographical distribution were characterized using eBURST and minimum spanning tree analyses. There were 609 samples from men having sex with men (MSM), with 4 predominating STs detected in this group, comprising 63% of MSM cases. Four other STs predominated among 1,383 heterosexual cases comprising, 31% of this group. The diversity index in ocular trachoma cases was significantly lower than in sexually transmitted chlamydia infections. Predominating STs were identified in 12 available C. trachomatis whole genomes which were compared to 22 C. trachomatis full genomes without predominating STs. No specific gene in the 12 genomes with predominating STs could be linked to successful spread of certain STs.

The Genetics of Personality Consortium has created a resource for genome-wide association analyses of personality traits in more than 63,000 participants (including MDD cases).\n\nTo identify genetic variants associated with neuroticism by performing a meta-analysis of genome-wide association results based on 1000 Genomes imputation; to evaluate whether common genetic variants as assessed by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain variation in neuroticism by estimating SNP-based heritability; and to examine whether SNPs that predict neuroticism also predict MDD.\n\nGenome-wide association meta-analysis of 30 cohorts with genome-wide genotype, personality, and MDD data from the Genetics of Personality Consortium. The study included 63,661 participants from 29 discovery cohorts and 9786 participants from a replication cohort. Participants came from Europe, the United States, or Australia. Analyses were conducted between 2012 and 2014.\n\nNeuroticism scores harmonized across all 29 discovery cohorts by item response theory analysis, and clinical MDD case-control status in 2 of the cohorts.\n\nA genome-wide significant SNP was found on 3p14 in MAGI1 (rs35855737; P\u2009=\u20099.26\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9 in the discovery meta-analysis).

Common genetic variants explain 15% of the variance in neuroticism. Polygenic scores based on the meta-analysis of neuroticism in 27 cohorts significantly predicted neuroticism (1.09\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12\u2009<\u2009P\u2009<\u2009.05) and MDD (4.02\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9\u2009<\u2009P\u2009<\u2009.05) in the 2 other cohorts.\n\nThis study identifies a novel locus for neuroticism.

In addition, the study shows that neuroticism is influenced by many genetic variants of small effect that are either common or tagged by common variants. These genetic variants also influence MDD. Future studies should confirm the role of the MAGI1 locus for neuroticism and further investigate the association of MAGI1 and the polygenic association to a range of other psychiatric disorders that are phenotypically correlated with neuroticism.", "doi": "10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0554", "pmid": "25993607", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2294268"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4667957"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS738804"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e430c3c2465144f8b15ecfdbc0823217.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e430c3c2465144f8b15ecfdbc0823217"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fbaede1e61f042389f09ecf64caaa22f", "title": "Toward Rare Blood Cell Preservation for RNA Sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Vickovic", "given": "Sanja", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ahmadian", "given": "Afshin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lewensohn", "given": "Rolf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "17", "issn": "1943-7811", "issue": "4", "pages": "352-359", "title": "J Mol Diagn"}, "abstract": "Cancer is driven by various events leading to cell differentiation and disease progression. Molecular tools are powerful approaches for describing how and why these events occur. With the growing field of next-generation DNA sequencing, there is an increasing need for high-quality nucleic acids derived from human cells and tissues-a prerequisite for successful cell profiling. Although advances in RNA preservation have been made, some of the largest biobanks still do not employ RNA blood preservation as standard because of limitations in low blood-input volume and RNA stability over the whole gene body. Therefore, we have developed a robust protocol for blood preservation and long-term storage while maintaining RNA integrity. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of using the protocol for preserving rare cell samples, such as circulating tumor cells. The results of our study confirmed that gene expression was not impacted by the preservation procedure (r(2)\u00a0>\u00a00.88) or by long-term storage (r(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.95), with RNA integrity number values averaging over 8. Similarly, cell surface antigens were still available for antibody selection (r(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Lastly, data mining for fusion events showed that it was possible to detect rare tumor cells among a background of other cells present in blood irrespective of fixation.

Chitinases are hydrolytic enzymes responsible for chitin degradation and it is suggested that they play an important role in fungal-fungal interactions. Fungal chitinases belong exclusively to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18.These GH18 proteins are categorized into three distinct phylogenetic groups (A, B and C), subdivided into several subgroups. In this study, we identified 14 GH18 genes in the C. rosea genome, which is remarkably low compared with the high numbers found in mycoparasitic Trichoderma species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C. rosea contains eight genes in group A, two genes in group B, two genes in group C, one gene encoding a putative ENGase (endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase) and the ech37 gene, which is of bacterial origin. Gene expression analysis showed that only two genes had higher transcription levels during fungal-fungal interactions, while eight out of 14 GH18 genes were triggered by chitin. Furthermore, deletion of the C group chiC2 gene decreased the growth inhibitory activity of C. rosea culture filtrates against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani, although the biocontrol ability of C. rosea against B. cinerea was not affected.

The cohort contained many patients with poor performance status (39% PS 2-4) and elderly (37% age>75), groups usually not included in clinical trials.

Screening for BRAF mutations before selection of treatment is relevant for many patients, especially outside clinical trials. A BRAF mutation only partly explained the very poor prognosis of many mCRC patients. Survival in unselected metastatic colorectal cancer patients is extremely variable and subgroups have an extremely short survival compared to trial patients. Patients without available TMA had worse prognostic factors and shorter survival, which questions the total generalizability of present TMA studies and implies that we lack information on the biologically worst mCRC cases.

Gene expression analysis suggested that Ebf1 was involved in the regulation of genes important for DNA repair and cell survival. Investigation of the DNA damage in steady state, as well as after induction of DNA damage by UV light, confirmed that pro-B cells lacking 1 functional allele of Ebf1 display signs of increased DNA damage. This correlated to reduced expression of DNA repair genes including Rad51, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggested that Rad51 is a direct target for Ebf1. Although reduced dosage of Ebf1 did not significantly increase tumor formation in mice, a dramatic increase in the frequency of pro-B cell leukemia was observed in mice with combined heterozygous mutations in the Ebf1 and Pax5 genes, revealing a synergistic effect of combined dose reduction of these proteins.

We studied four pairs of in vitro and ex vivo fibroblast lines which, within each pair, differed in their capacity to inhibit cancer cells. The natural process was modeled in vitro by confronting the fibroblasts with PC-3 cancer cells. Fibroblast transcriptomes were recorded by Affymetrix microarrays and then investigated using network analysis.\n\nThe network enrichment analysis allowed us to separate confrontation- and inhibition-specific components of the fibroblast transcriptional response. Confrontation-specific differences were stronger and were characterized by changes in a number of pathways, including Rho, the YAP/TAZ cascade, NF-kB, and TGF-beta signaling, as well as the transcription factor RELA. Inhibition-specific differences were more subtle and characterized by involvement of Rho signaling at the pathway level and by potential individual regulators such as IL6, MAPK8, MAP2K4, PRKCA, JUN, STAT3, and STAT5A.\n\nWe investigated the interaction between cancer cells and fibroblasts in order to shed light on the potential mechanisms and explain the differential inhibitory capacity of the latter, which enabled both a holistic view on the process and details at the gene/protein level. The combination of our methods pointed to proteins, such as members of the Rho pathway, pro-inflammatory signature and the YAP1/TAZ cascade, that warrant further investigation via tools of experimental perturbation.

Infertility is common in both males and females with APS1. Although female infertility can be explained by autoimmune ovarian failure, the mechanisms underlying male infertility have remained poorly understood. We performed a proteome-wide autoantibody screen in APS1 patient sera to assess the autoimmune response against the male reproductive organs. By screening human protein arrays with male and female patient sera and by selecting for gender-imbalanced autoantibody signals, we identified transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) as a male-specific autoantigen. Notably, TGM4 is a prostatic secretory molecule with critical role in male reproduction. TGM4 autoantibodies were detected in most of the adult male APS1 patients but were absent in all the young males. Consecutive serum samples further revealed that TGM4 autoantibodies first presented during pubertal age and subsequent to prostate maturation. We assessed the animal model for APS1, the Aire-deficient mouse, and found spontaneous development of TGM4 autoantibodies specifically in males. Aire-deficient mice failed to present TGM4 in the thymus, consistent with a defect in central tolerance for TGM4. In the mouse, we further link TGM4 immunity with a destructive prostatitis and compromised secretion of TGM4.

We investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases affect the IFN-\u03b1 production in healthy individuals. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), B cells and NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals and stimulated with RNA-containing immune complexes (ICs), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or the oligonucleotide ODN2216. IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs alone or in cocultures with B or NK cells was measured by an immunoassay. All donors were genotyped with the 200K ImmunoChip, and a 5 bp CGGGG length polymorphism in the IFN regulatory factor 5 gene (IRF5) was genotyped by PCR. We found associations between IFN-\u03b1 production and 18-86 SNPs (P \u2264 0.001), depending on the combination of the stimulated cell types. However, only three of these associated SNPs were shared between the cell-type combinations. Several SNPs showed novel associations to the type I IFN system among all the associated SNPs, whereas some loci have been described earlier for their association with SLE. Furthermore, we found that the SLE-risk variant of the IRF5 CGGGG-indel was associated with lower IFN-\u03b1 production.

Detailed analysis of the transcripts and the genetic landscape of brain-enriched coding and non-coding genes revealed brain-enriched splice variants.

The most common e-infrastructure for analyzing this data consists of batch systems that are based on high-performance computing resources; however, the bioinformatics software that is built on this platform does not scale well in the general case. Recently, the Hadoop platform has emerged as an interesting option to address the challenges of increasingly large datasets with distributed storage, distributed processing, built-in data locality, fault tolerance, and an appealing programming methodology.\n\nIn this work we introduce metrics and report on a quantitative comparison between Hadoop and a single node of conventional high-performance computing resources for the tasks of short read mapping and variant calling. We calculate efficiency as a function of data size and observe that the Hadoop platform is more efficient for biologically relevant data sizes in terms of computing hours for both split and un-split data files. We also quantify the advantages of the data locality provided by Hadoop for NGS problems, and show that a classical architecture with network-attached storage will not scale when computing resources increase in numbers. Measurements were performed using ten datasets of different sizes, up to 100 gigabases, using the pipeline implemented in Crossbow. To make a fair comparison, we implemented an improved preprocessor for Hadoop with better performance for splittable data files. For improved usability, we implemented a graphical user interface for Crossbow in a private cloud environment using the CloudGene platform. All of the code and data in this study are freely available as open source in public repositories.\n\nFrom our experiments we can conclude that the improved Hadoop pipeline scales better than the same pipeline on high-performance computing resources, we also conclude that Hadoop is an economically viable option for the common data sizes that are currently used in massively parallel sequencing.

Thus, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 18 core complex genes within the NF-\u03baB pathway in a discovery and validation CLL cohort totaling 315 cases. The most frequently mutated gene was NFKBIE (21/315 cases; 7%), which encodes I\u03baB\u03b5, a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB in normal B cells. Strikingly, 13 of these cases carried an identical 4-bp frameshift deletion, resulting in a truncated protein. Screening of an additional 377 CLL cases revealed that NFKBIE aberrations predominated in poor-prognostic patients and were associated with inferior outcome. Minor subclones and/or clonal evolution were also observed, thus potentially linking this recurrent event to disease progression. Compared with wild-type patients, NFKBIE-deleted cases showed reduced I\u03baB\u03b5 protein levels and decreased p65 inhibition, along with increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. Considering the central role of B cell receptor (BcR) signaling in CLL pathobiology, it is notable that I\u03baB\u03b5 loss was enriched in aggressive cases with distinctive stereotyped BcR, likely contributing to their poor prognosis, and leading to an altered response to BcR inhibitors.

As a proof of concept we have evaluated the effect of silicate ions on the zebrafish larvae and compared it to a well-known osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1 subclone 14. We have shown that sodium metasilicate (125 \u03bcM and 625 \u03bcM) induces more mineralisation in a dose-dependent manner in zebrafish larvae, 9 days post fertilisation as compared to the non-treated group. Moreover the same trends were seen when adding sodium metasilicate to MC3T3-E1 cultures, with more mineralisation and higher ALP levels with higher doses of silicate (25, 125 and 625 \u03bcM).

While hybridizations of C. rubella maternal plants with C. grandiflora pollen donors resulted in complete seed abortion caused by endosperm cellularization failure, the reciprocal hybridization resulted in the formation of small seeds with precociously cellularized endosperm. Strikingly, the transcriptomic response of both hybridizations mimicked respectively the response of paternal and maternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting unbalanced genome strength causes hybridization failure in both species. These results provide strong support for the theory that crosses between plants of different mating systems will be unbalanced, with the outcrosser behaving like a plant of increased ploidy, evoking a response that resembles an interploidy-type seed failure. Seed incompatilibity of C. rubella pollinated by C. grandiflora followed the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, involving negative genetic interaction of multiple paternal C. grandiflora loci with at least one maternal C. rubella locus.

Based on sequence similarity, these proteins are putative transporters of ligands to gustatory receptors in sensory organs of insects. We sought to determine whether these proteins are inducible by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the salivary (mandibular and labial) proteomes from caterpillars (Vanessa cardui) reared on different plants and artificial diet containing either bacteria or bacterial cell-walls. We included a treatment where the caterpillars were switched from feeding on artificial diet to plant material at some point in their development. Additionally, we evaluated the degree of overlap between the proteomes in the hemolymph-filled coelom and salivary glands of caterpillars reared on plant material. We found that the quality and quantity of the identified proteins differed clearly between hemolymph-filled coelome, labial and mandibular glands. Our results indicated that even after molting and two-day feeding on a new diet, protein production is affected by the previous food source used by the caterpillar. Candidate proteins involved in chemosensory perception by insects were detected: three chemosensory (CSPs) and two odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). Using the relative amounts of these proteins across tissues and treatments as criteria for their classification, we detected hemolymph- and mandibular gland-specific CSPs and observed that their levels were affected by caterpillar diet. Moreover, we could compare the protein and transcript levels across tissues and treatment for at least one CSP and one OBP. Therefore, we have identified specific isoforms for testing the role of CSPs and OBPs in plant and pathogen recognition. We detected catalase, immune-related protein and serine proteases and their inhibitors in high relative levels in the mandibular glands in comparison to the labial glands. These findings suggest that the mandibular glands of caterpillars may play an important role protecting the caterpillar from oxidative stress, pathogens and aiding in digestion.

The genome-wide location of histones was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease methodology (ChIP-exo). The findings were compared with diverse chromatin marks, including histone variant H2A.Z, post-translational histone modifications, and Pol II binding. Finally, genome-wide mapping of the methylation states of H4K20 was performed to determine the relationship between methylation (mono, di, and tri) of this residue and nucleosome turnover. Our analysis showed that histone recycling resulted in low nucleosome turnover in the coding regions of active genes, stably expressed at intermediate levels. High levels of transcription resulted in the incorporation of new histones primarily at the end of transcribed units. H4K20 was methylated in low-turnover nucleosomes in euchromatic regions, notably in the coding regions of long genes that were expressed at low levels. This transcription-dependent accumulation of histone methylation was dependent on the histone chaperone complex FACT. Our data showed that nucleosome turnover is highly dynamic in the genome and that several mechanisms are at play to either maintain or suppress stability.

All studied poplars have sex determination loci on chromosome XIX, however, the position differs among species and both male and female heterogametic system exists. In contrast to the situation in poplars, knowledge of sex determination mechanisms in willows is sparse. In the present study, we have for the first time positioned the sex determination locus on chromosome XV in S. viminalis using quantitative trait locus mapping. All female offspring carried a maternally inherited haplotype, suggesting a system of female heterogamety or ZW. We used a comparative mapping approach and compared the positions of the markers between the S. viminalis linkage map and the physical maps of S. purpurea, S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa. As we found no evidence for chromosomal rearrangements between chromosome XV and XIX between S. viminalis and P. trichocarpa, it shows that the sex determination loci in the willow and the poplar most likely do not share a common origin and has thus evolved separately. This demonstrates that sex determination mechanisms in the Salicaceae family have a high turnover rate and as such it is excellent for studies of evolutionary processes involved in sex chromosome turnover.", "doi": "10.1038/hdy.2014.125", "pmid": "25649501", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "hdy2014125"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4434249"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a7ca7ed5c5a44477bf8dd15159b380d5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a7ca7ed5c5a44477bf8dd15159b380d5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "aa441f2d8f9d4684adb543306810523d", "title": "Whole-genome Linkage Analysis and Sequence Analysis of Candidate Loci in Familial Breast Cancer.", "authors": [{"family": "Marikkannu", "given": "Rajeshwari", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Aravidis", "given": "Christos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Rantala", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Picelli", "given": "Simone", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Adamovic", "given": "Tatjana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Keihas", "given": "Markku", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Tao", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Kontham", "given": "Vinaykumar", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lindblom", "given": "Annika", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "35", "issn": "1791-7530", "issue": "6", "pages": "3155-3165", "title": "Anticancer Res."}, "abstract": "Known breast cancer-predisposing genes account for fewer than 25% of all familial breast cancer cases and further studies are required to find the remaining high- and moderate-risk genes.

Exome and whole-genome sequencing of solid tumors has previously been used to investigate the clonal relationship between primary tumors and metastases in several diseases.

Low-risk patients are not considered to require adjuvant therapy or staging lymphadenectomy. For patients with intermediate or high risk, some guidelines recommend tailoring adjuvant treatment according to additional negative prognostic factors. Our objective was to evaluate the biomarker potential of the ASRGL1 protein in endometrial carcinoma.\n\nUsing The Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org), the l-asparaginase (ASRGL1) protein was identified as an endometrial carcinoma biomarker candidate. ASRGL1 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated with an extensively validated antibody on two independent endometrial carcinoma cohorts (n=229 and n=286) arranged as tissue microarrays. Staining results were correlated with clinical features.\n\nReduced expression of ASRGL1, defined as <75% positively stained tumor cells, was significantly associated with poor prognosis and reduced disease-specific survival in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEA). In multivariate analysis the hazard ratios for disease-specific survival were 3.55 (95% CI=1.10-11.43; p=0.003) and 3.23 (95% CI=1.53-6.81; p=0.002) in the two cohorts, respectively. Of the 48 cases with Grade 3 Stage I tumor all disease-related deaths were associated with low ASRGL1 expression.\n\nLoss of ASRGL1 in EEA is a powerful biomarker for poor prognosis and retained ASRGL1 has a positive impact on survival.

In addition to true gall formers, gall wasps also include phytophagous inquilines, which live inside the galls induced by gall wasps or other insects. Here we present the first comprehensive molecular and total-evidence analyses of higher-level gall wasp relationships. We studied more than 100 taxa representing a rich selection of outgroups and the majority of described cynipid genera outside the diverse oak gall wasps (Cynipini), which were more sparsely sampled. About 5 kb of nucleotide data from one mitochondrial (COI) and four nuclear (28S, LWRh, EF1alpha F1, and EF1alpha F2) markers were analyzed separately and in combination with morphological and life-history data. According to previous morphology-based studies, gall wasps evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and were initially herb gallers. Inquilines originated once from gall inducers that lost the ability to initiate galls. Our results, albeit not conclusive, suggest a different scenario. The first gall wasps were more likely associated with woody host plants, and there must have been multiple origins of gall inducers, inquilines or both. One possibility is that gall inducers arose independently from inquilines in several lineages. Except for these surprising results, our analyses are largely consistent with previous studies. They confirm that gall wasps are conservative in their host-plant preferences, and that herb-galling lineages have radiated repeatedly onto the same set of unrelated host plants. We propose a revised classification of the family into twelve tribes, which are strongly supported as monophyletic across independent datasets. Four are new: Aulacideini, Phanacidini, Diastrophini and Ceroptresini. We present a key to the tribes and discuss their morphological and biological diversity.

Here, we present high-quality complete genome sequences from two woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). The first mammoth was sequenced at 17.1-fold coverage and dates to \u223c4,300 years before present, representing one of the last surviving individuals on Wrangel Island. The second mammoth, sequenced at 11.2-fold coverage, was obtained from an \u223c44,800-year-old specimen from the Late Pleistocene population in northeastern Siberia. The demographic trajectories inferred from the two genomes are qualitatively similar and reveal a population bottleneck during the Middle or Early Pleistocene, and a more recent severe decline in the ancestors of the Wrangel mammoth at the end of the last glaciation. A comparison of the two genomes shows that the Wrangel mammoth has a 20% reduction in heterozygosity as well as a 28-fold increase in the fraction of the genome that comprises runs of homozygosity.

CD55 is widely localized in the cholesterol rich regions of the cell plasma membrane termed membrane rafts. CD55 is attached to these specialized regions via a GPI link on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Membrane rafts anchor many important signaling proteins, which control several cellular functions within the cell. For example, we recently demonstrated that the membrane raft protein and complement inhibitor CD59 also controls insulin secretion by an intracellular mechanism. Therefore, we have in this study aimed at addressing the expression and function of CD55 in pancreatic beta cells. To this end, we observe that CD55 is highly expressed in INS1 832/13 beta cells as well as human pancreatic islets. Diabetic human islets show a tendency for increased expression of CD55 when compared to the healthy controls. Importantly, silencing of CD55 in INS1 832/13 cells does not affect their insulin secretory capacity. On the other hand, silencing of CD55 diminished the intensity of membrane rafts as determined by Atto-SM staining. We hence conclude that CD55 expression is affected by glycemic status in human islets and plays a critical role in maintaining the conserved structure of rafts in pancreatic islets, which is similar to that of the related complement inhibitor CD59. However CD55 does not interfere with insulin secretion in beta cells, which is in sharp contrast to the action of the complement inhibitor CD59.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.062", "pmid": "25797618", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0006-291X(15)00508-2"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4b8ef72e35594e09919743f5a71ab6c4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4b8ef72e35594e09919743f5a71ab6c4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4669d6258b854317a0d7200a21dd2104", "title": "Genome-wide association mapping in a wild avian population identifies a link between genetic and phenotypic variation in a life-history trait.", "authors": [{"family": "Husby", "given": "Arild", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kawakami", "given": "Takeshi", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "R\u00f6nneg\u00e5rd", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Smeds", "given": "Linn\u00e9a", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ellegren", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Qvarnstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-05-07", "journal": {"volume": "282", "issn": "1471-2954", "issue": "1806", "pages": "20150156", "title": "Proc.

We performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) mapping study in an advanced intercross based on Red Junglefowl (the wild progenitor of the modern domestic chicken) and White Leghorn chickens. We measured femoral bone traits in 456 chickens by peripheral computerised tomography and femoral gene expression in a subset of 125 females from the cross with microarrays. This resulted in 25 loci for female bone traits, 26 loci for male bone traits and 6318 local eQTL loci. We then overlapped bone and gene expression loci, before checking for an association between gene expression and trait values to identify candidate quantitative trait genes for bone traits. A handful of our candidates have been previously associated with bone traits in mice, but our results also implicate unexpected and largely unknown genes in bone metabolism. In summary, by utilising the unique bone metabolism of an avian species, we have identified a number of candidate genes affecting bone allocation and metabolism.

We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30\u2009062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.", "doi": "10.1038/mp.2014.107", "pmid": "25288136", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mp2014107"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4388784"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS648794"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/348eb4684db64e75abc60753ee27632b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/348eb4684db64e75abc60753ee27632b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "531bf6acdc8b4088807b5bb2f222069c", "title": "Mixed ancestry and admixture in Kauai's feral chickens: invasion of domestic genes into ancient Red Junglefowl reservoirs.", "authors": [{"family": "Gering", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Johnsson", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Willis", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Getty", "given": "T", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wright", "given": "D", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "1365-294X", "issue": "9", "pages": "2112-2124", "title": "Mol.

While domesticated species commonly escape cultivation to invade feral habitats, few studies have examined how this process shapes feral gene pools and traits. We collected genomic and phenotypic data from feral chickens (Gallus gallus) on the Hawaiian island of Kauai to (i) ascertain their origins and (ii) measure standing variation in feral genomes, morphology and behaviour. Mitochondrial phylogenies (D-loop & whole Mt genome) revealed two divergent clades within our samples. The rare clade also contains sequences from Red Junglefowl (the domestic chicken's progenitor) and ancient DNA sequences from Kauai that predate European contact. This lineage appears to have been dispersed into the east Pacific by ancient Polynesian colonists. The more prevalent MtDNA clade occurs worldwide and includes domesticated breeds developed recently in Europe that are farmed within Hawaii. We hypothesize this lineage originates from recently feralized livestock and found supporting evidence for increased G. gallus density on Kauai within the last few decades. SNPs obtained from whole-genome sequencing were consistent with historic admixture between Kauai's divergent (G. gallus) lineages. Additionally, analyses of plumage, skin colour and vocalizations revealed that Kauai birds' behaviours and morphologies overlap with those of domestic chickens and Red Junglefowl, suggesting hybrid origins. Together, our data support the hypotheses that (i) Kauai's feral G. gallus descend from recent invasion(s) of domestic chickens into an ancient Red Junglefowl reservoir and (ii) feral chickens exhibit greater phenotypic diversity than candidate source populations. These findings complicate management objectives for Pacific feral chickens, while highlighting the potential of this and other feral systems for evolutionary studies of invasions.", "doi": "10.1111/mec.13096", "pmid": "25655399", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "BioProject", "key": "PRJNA272379"}, {"db": "Dryad", "key": "NV3QS"}, {"db": "SRA", "key": "SRP052017"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/531bf6acdc8b4088807b5bb2f222069c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/531bf6acdc8b4088807b5bb2f222069c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "59ff6bfc70654b84bba7813dd1f9b39e", "title": "NOTA: a potent metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor", "authors": [{"family": "Somboro", "given": "Anou M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Tiwari", "given": "Dileep", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Bester", "given": "Linda A", "initials": "LA"}, {"family": "Parboosing", "given": "Raveen", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Chonco", "given": "Louis", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kruger", "given": "Hendrick G", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Arvidsson", "given": "Per I", "initials": "PI"}, {"family": "Govender", "given": "Thavendran", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Naicker", "given": "Tricia", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Essack", "given": "Sabiha Y", "initials": "SY"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "70", "issn": "1460-2091", "issue": "5", "pages": "1594-1596", "title": "J.

studies have reported different effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors across age and sex. Since cardiovascular risk factors are enriched in obese individuals, it has not been easy to dissect the effects of adiposity from those of other risk factors. We used a Mendelian randomization approach, applying a set of 32 genetic markers to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, glycemic indices, circulating lipid levels, and markers of inflammation and liver disease in up to 67,553 individuals. All analyses were stratified by age (cutoff 55 years of age) and sex. The genetic score was associated with BMI in both nonstratified analysis (P = 2.8 \u00d7 10(-107)) and stratified analyses (all P < 3.3 \u00d7 10(-30)). We found evidence of a causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, fasting levels of insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a nonstratified analysis and in the <55-year stratum. Further, we found evidence of a smaller causal effect on total cholesterol (P for difference = 0.015) in the \u226555-year stratum than in the <55-year stratum, a finding that could be explained by biology, survival bias, or differential medication.

This emphasizes the importance of intraprostatic tumor heterogeneity for prediction of prognosis. These findings also support recent evidence that intraductal carcinoma is a marker of aggressive disease.\n\nWe identified the area in the prostate that gave rise to metastases by searching for metastatic-specific DNA alterations in multiple regions of the prostate. The metastasizing component grew within prostatic ducts, suggesting that intraductal cancer should be reported when found in needle biopsies.

An RNA silencing strategy was evaluated here to clarify if small interfering RNA homologous to selected genes in P. infestans could be targeted from the plant host to reduce the magnitude of the infection. As a proof-of-concept, a hairpin RNA (hp-RNA) construct using the GFP marker gene was designed and introduced in potato. At 72 hpi, a 55-fold reduction of the signal intensity of a corresponding GFP expressing P. infestans strain on leaf samples of transgenic plants, compared with wild-type potato, was detected. This suggests that an RNA interference construct in the potato host could be processed and target a transcript of the pathogen. Three genes important in the infection process of P. infestans, PiGPB1, PiCESA2, and PiPEC, together with PiGAPDH taking part in basic cell maintenance were subsequently tested using an analogous transgenic strategy. Out of these gene candidates, the hp-PiGPB1 targeting the G protein \u03b2-subunit (PiGPB1) important for pathogenicity resulted in most restricted disease progress. Further, Illumina sequencing of inoculated transgenic potato leaves revealed sRNAs of 24/25 nt size homologous to the PiGPB1 gene in the transgenic plants indicating post-transcriptional silencing of the target gene. The work demonstrates that a host-induced gene-silencing approach is functional against P. infestans but is highly dependent on target gene for a successful outcome.

Using individual-level genotype data from 18,249 persons, we also examined the risk of CAD associated with the presence of various numbers of height-associated alleles.

There was a graded relationship between the presence of an increased number of height-raising variants and a reduced risk of CAD (odds ratio for height quartile 4 versus quartile 1, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84; P<0.001). Of the 12 risk factors that we studied, we observed significant associations only with levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (accounting for approximately 30% of the association). We identified several overlapping pathways involving genes associated with both development and atherosclerosis.\n\nThere is a primary association between a genetically determined shorter height and an increased risk of CAD, a link that is partly explained by the association between shorter height and an adverse lipid profile. Shared biologic processes that determine achieved height and the development of atherosclerosis may explain some of the association.

Although the mechanisms promoting this condition are not known, several circulating proteins have been proposed to contribute. We analyzed the plasma proteome in cancer subjects in order to identify factors associated with cachexia.\n\nPlasma was obtained from a screening cohort of 59 patients, newly diagnosed with suspected gastrointestinal cancer, with (n = 32) or without (n = 27) cachexia. Samples were subjected to proteomic profiling using 760 antibodies (targeting 698 individual proteins) from the Human Protein Atlas project. The main findings were validated in a cohort of 93 patients with verified and advanced pancreas cancer.\n\nOnly six proteins displayed differential plasma levels in the screening cohort. Among these, Carnosine Dipeptidase 1 (CNDP1) was confirmed by sandwich immunoassay to be lower in CC (p = 0.008). In both cohorts, low CNDP1 levels were associated with markers of poor prognosis including weight loss, malnutrition, lipid breakdown, low circulating albumin/IGF1 levels and poor quality of life. Eleven of the subjects in the discovery cohort were finally diagnosed with non-malignant disease but omitting these subjects from the analyses did not have any major influence on the results.\n\nIn gastrointestinal cancer, reduced plasma levels of CNDP1 associate with signs of catabolism and poor outcome. These results, together with recently published data demonstrating lower circulating CNDP1 in subjects with glioblastoma and metastatic prostate cancer, suggest that CNDP1 may constitute a marker of aggressive cancer and CC.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0123566", "pmid": "25898255", "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-14-54419"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4405487"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4ae59f5aa7af43cb83377b7e1b1a82b5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4ae59f5aa7af43cb83377b7e1b1a82b5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "78276dddd29644c4861c974a0e9a70a7", "title": "Polymorphisms in chloroquine resistance-associated genes in Plasmodium vivax in Ethiopia.", "authors": [{"family": "Golassa", "given": "Lemu", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Erko", "given": "Berhanu", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Baliraine", "given": "Frederick N", "initials": "FN"}, {"family": "Aseffa", "given": "Abraham", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Swedberg", "given": "G\u00f6te", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-04-16", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1475-2875", "issue": null, "pages": "164", "title": "Malar. J."}, "abstract": "Evidence for decreasing chloroquine (CQ) efficacy against Plasmodium vivax has been reported from many endemic countries in the world. In Ethiopia, P. vivax accounts for 40% of all malaria cases and CQ is the first-line drug for vivax malaria. Mutations in multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr-1) and K10 insertion in the pvcrt-o genes have been identified as possible molecular markers of CQ-resistance (CQR) in P. vivax. Despite reports of CQ treatment failures, no data are currently available on the prevalence of molecular markers of P. vivax resistance in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in the pvmdr-1 and K10 insertion in the pvcrt-o genes.\n\nA total of 36 P. vivax clinical isolates were collected from West Arsi district in Ethiopia. Sequencing was used to analyse polymorphisms of the pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1 genes.\n\nSequencing results of the pvmdr-1 fragment showed the presence of two non-synonymous mutations at positions 976 and 1076. The Y\u2009\u2192\u2009F change at codon 976 (TAC\u2009\u2192\u2009TTC) was observed in 21 (75%) of 28 the isolates while the F\u2009\u2192\u2009L change (at codon 1076), which was due to a single mutation (TTT\u2009\u2192\u2009CTT), was observed in 100% of the isolates. Of 33 samples successfully amplified for the pvcrt-o, the majority of the isolates (93.9%) were wild type, without K10 insertion.\n\nHigh prevalence of mutations in candidate genes conferring CQR in P. vivax was identified. The fact that CQ is still the first-line treatment for vivax malaria, the significance of mutations in the pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1 genes and the clinical response of the patients' to CQ treatment and whether thus an association exists between point mutations of the candidate genes and CQR requires further research in Ethiopia.", "doi": "10.1186/s12936-015-0625-3", "pmid": "25889237", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12936-015-0625-3"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4404130"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/78276dddd29644c4861c974a0e9a70a7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/78276dddd29644c4861c974a0e9a70a7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "40d7060d11de4d7890a7bcc2d04ac670", "title": "AP-1-mediated chromatin looping regulates ZEB2 transcription: new insights into TNF\u03b1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in triple-negative breast cancer.", "authors": [{"family": "Qiao", "given": "Yichun", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Shiue", "given": "Chiou-Nan", "initials": "CN"}, {"family": "Zhu", "given": "Jian", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Zhuang", "given": "Ting", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Jonsson", "given": "Philip", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Wright", "given": "Anthony P H", "initials": "AP"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Chunyan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Dahlman-Wright", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-04-10", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1949-2553", "issue": "10", "pages": "7804-7814", "title": "Oncotarget"}, "abstract": "The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviour in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. In this study, we demonstrate that the inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 induces EMT in TNBC cells via activation of AP-1 signaling and subsequently induces expression of the EMT regulator ZEB2. We also show that TNF\u03b1 activates both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, which act upstream of AP-1. We further investigated in detail AP-1 regulation of ZEB2 expression. We show that two ZEB2 transcripts derived from distinct promoters are both expressed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples. Using the chromosome conformation capture assay, we demonstrate that AP-1, when activated by TNF\u03b1, binds to a site in promoter 1b of the ZEB2 gene where it regulates the expression of both promoter 1b and 1a, the latter via mediating long range chromatin interactions. Overall, this work provides a plausible mechanism for inflammation-induced metastatic potential in TNBC, involving a novel regulatory mechanism governing ZEB2 isoform expression.", "doi":

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.", "doi": "10.1038/nature14101", "pmid": "25607358", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature14101"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4393366"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS672777"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c046e53c2f2b472296b911f7cca53aca.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c046e53c2f2b472296b911f7cca53aca"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b39a0b55c88345ad974642c1f79dd1b3", "title": "Inter-relationships between the metrics of instrumental meat color and microbial growth during aerobic storage of beef at 4\u00b0C", "authors": [{"family": "Li", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zamaratskaia", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Roos", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "B\u00e5th", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Meijer", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Borch", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-04-03", "journal": {"volume": "65", "issn": "0906-4702", "issue": "2", "pages": "97-106", "title": "Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section A - Animal Science"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/09064702.2015.1072579", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b39a0b55c88345ad974642c1f79dd1b3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b39a0b55c88345ad974642c1f79dd1b3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "46b24a756ae146c3ae7b44a2c64c44d3", "title": "Transplant experiments uncover Baltic Sea basin-specific responses in bacterioplankton community composition and metabolic activities.", "authors": [{"family": "Lindh", "given": "Markus V", "initials": "MV"}, {"family": "Figueroa", "given": "Daniela", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6stedt", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Baltar", "given": "Federico", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Lundin", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Agneta", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Legrand", "given": "Catherine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pinhassi", "given": "Jarone", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-04-01", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1664-302X", "issue": null, "pages": "223", "title": "Front Microbiol"}, "abstract": "Anthropogenically induced changes in precipitation are projected to generate increased river runoff to semi-enclosed seas, increasing loads of terrestrial dissolved organic matter and decreasing salinity. To determine how bacterial community structure and functioning adjust to such changes, we designed microcosm transplant experiments with Baltic Proper (salinity 7.2) and Bothnian Sea (salinity 3.6) water. Baltic Proper bacteria generally reached higher abundances than Bothnian Sea bacteria in both Baltic Proper and Bothnian Sea water, indicating higher adaptability. Moreover, Baltic Proper bacteria growing in Bothnian Sea water consistently showed highest bacterial production and beta-glucosidase activity. These metabolic responses were accompanied by basin-specific changes in bacterial community structure. For example, Baltic Proper Pseudomonas and Limnobacter populations increased markedly in relative abundance in Bothnian Sea water, indicating a replacement effect. In contrast, Roseobacter and Rheinheimera populations were stable or increased in abundance when challenged by either of the waters, indicating an adjustment effect. Transplants to Bothnian Sea water triggered the initial emergence of particular Burkholderiaceae populations, and transplants to Baltic Proper water triggered Alteromonadaceae populations. Notably, in the subsequent re-transplant experiment, a priming effect resulted in further increases to dominance of these populations. Correlated changes in community composition and metabolic activity were observed only in the transplant experiment and only at relatively high phylogenetic resolution. This suggested an importance of successional progression for interpreting relationships between bacterial community composition and functioning. We infer that priming effects on bacterial community structure by natural episodic events or climate change induced forcing could translate into long-term changes in bacterial ecosystem process rates.", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2015.00223", "pmid": "25883589", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4381636"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/46b24a756ae146c3ae7b44a2c64c44d3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/46b24a756ae146c3ae7b44a2c64c44d3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d658f4b23c4346fd9fe015e04165cfed", "title": "A prognosis based classification of undifferentiated uterine sarcomas: identification of mitotic index, hormone receptors and YWHAE-FAM22 translocation status as predictors of survival.", "authors": [{"family": "Gremel", "given": "Gabriela", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Liew", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hamzei", "given": "Farzaneh", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hardell", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Selling", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ghaderi", "given": "Mehran", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Stemme", "given": "Sten", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Carlson", "given": "Joseph W", "initials": "JW"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-04-01", "journal": {"volume": "136", "issn": "1097-0215", "issue": "7", "pages": "1608-1618", "title": "Int.

The goal of this study was to examine clinicopathology, biomarkers and YWHAE-FAM22 translocation status, in the prognosis of these tumors. Twenty-six cases of UUS were included. All original slides were rereviewed and age at diagnosis, tumor stage, \"Kurihara\" diagnosis, mitotic index, presence of necrosis and grade of nuclear atypia were recorded. Additionally, a tissue microarray was constructed from 22 of the cases, and the protein biomarkers P53, P16, Ki-67, Cyclin-D1, ER, PR and ANLN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. All tumors were evaluated for the presence of a YWHAE-FAM translocation; the translocation was demonstrated in the three Cyclin-D1 positive tumors. Follow-up data in the form of overall survival were available on all patients. These tumors could be divided into two prognostic groups, a high mitotic index group (10 cases, M\u2009=\u200936.8, SD\u2009=\u20095.4) and a low mitotic index group (16 cases, M\u2009=\u20098.7, SD\u2009=\u20095.8). These two groups showed a statistically significant difference in prognosis. The expression of ER, PR or presence of the YWHAE-FAM22 translocation correlated with low mitotic index and an additionally improved prognosis, although the number of cases was small. These results indicate that UUS can be divided into two prognostic groups using mitotic index as a primary criteria, followed by expression of either ER, PR or the presence of a YWHAE-FAM22 translocation as a secondary criteria.

After larval exposure to LNG (0.1nM), or EE2 (0.1nM) singly, or in combination with LNG (0.01, 0.1, 1.0nM), the gonadal sex ratio was determined histologically and hepatic mRNA levels of genes encoding vitellogenin (vtg beta1) and the estrogen (esr1, esr2), progesterone (ipgr) and androgen (ar) receptors were quantified using quantitative PCR. All EE2-exposed groups showed female-biased sex ratios and increased vtg beta1 mRNA levels compared with the controls. Compared with the EE2-alone group (positive control) there were no significant alterations in vtg beta1 levels or in sex ratios in the co-exposure groups. Exposure to LNG-alone caused an increase in ar mRNA levels in females, but not in males, compared to the controls and the co-exposed groups, indicating that co-exposure to EE2 counteracted the LNG-induced ar levels. No treatment related impacts on the mRNA expression of esr1, esr2, and ipgr in female tadpoles were found, suggesting that these endpoints are insensitive to long-term exposure to estrogen or progestin. Due to the EE2-induced female-biased sex ratios, the mRNA expression data for the low number of males in the EE2-exposed groups were not statistically analyzed. In conclusion, our results suggest that induced vtg expression is a robust biomarker for estrogenic activity in exposure scenarios involving both estrogens and progestins. Developmental exposure to LNG caused an induction of hepatic ar mRNA expression that was antagonized by combined exposure to EE2 and LNG. To our knowledge this is the first study to report effects of combined exposures to EE2 and LNG during the period of sexual programming.", "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.004", "pmid": "25703176", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0166-445X(15)00055-7"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/65e2fa8e87a84716bc952243bbb58868.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/65e2fa8e87a84716bc952243bbb58868"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "793160d431b44446b26fb2736bb2c390", "title": "Birth weight as an independent predictor of ADHD symptoms: a within-twin pair analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6lander", "given": "Arvid", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Almqvist", "given": "Catarina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Anckars\u00e4ter", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "D'Onofrio", "given": "Brian M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Lichtenstein", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "56", "issn": "1469-7610", "issue": "4", "pages": "453-459", "title": "J Child Psychol Psychiatry"}, "abstract": "Studies have found an association between low birth weight and ADHD, but the nature of this relation is unclear.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence and function of autoantibodies targeting lectin-like NK cell receptors in SLE.\n\nSera from 203 SLE patients and 90 healthy individuals were analyzed, by flow cytometry, for Ig binding to Ba/F3 cells transfected with CD94/NKG2A, CD94/NKG2C, or NKG2D. Autoantibodies identified were characterized with regard to interference with HLA-E binding, effect on NK cell activation in response to HLA-E-transfected K562 cells, and capacity to facilitate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Levels of autoantibodies were determined in longitudinally sampled sera, and correlations with disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000) and severity (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index) were investigated.\n\nAnti-CD94/NKG2A autoantibodies were identified in 7 SLE patients. The autoantibodies from 6 patients inhibited binding of HLA-E to CD94/NKG2A, whereas those from the seventh patient augmented this binding. Autoantibodies from 2 patients also reacted with the activating receptor CD94/NKG2C, with inhibition of the binding of HLA-E to CD94/NKG2C observed in 1 case and enhancement of this binding in the other.

The active drug metabolite of oseltamivir (oseltamivir carboxylate [OC]), stockpiled as Tamiflu for influenza pandemic preparedness, is not removed by conventional sewage treatment and has been detected in river water. There, it may exert evolutionary pressure on avian IAV in waterfowl, resulting in the development of resistant viral variants. A resistant avian IAV can circulate among wild birds only if resistance does not restrict viral fitness and if the resistant virus can persist without continuous drug pressure. In this in vivo mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) study, we tested whether an OC-resistant avian IAV (H1N1) strain with an H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA-H274Y) could retain resistance while drug pressure was gradually removed. Successively infected mallards were exposed to decreasing levels of OC, and fecal samples were analyzed for the neuraminidase sequence and phenotypic resistance. No reversion to wild-type virus was observed during the experiment, which included 17 days of viral transmission among 10 ducks exposed to OC concentrations below resistance induction levels. We conclude that resistance in avian IAV that is induced by exposure of the natural host to OC can persist in the absence of the drug. Thus, there is a risk that human-pathogenic IAVs that evolve from IAVs circulating among wild birds may contain resistance mutations. An oseltamivir-resistant pandemic IAV would pose a substantial public health threat.

These results open new perspectives to understand leukocyte maturation and provide a catalogue of CpG sites that may need to be corrected for age effects when performing DNA methylation studies in children.", "doi": "10.1186/s13148-015-0064-6", "pmid": "25874017", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "64"}, {"db": "pmc", "key":

variants affecting serum urate levels, genome-wide, in up to 42569 participants. Both stratified genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses, in lean, overweight and obese individuals, and regression-type analyses in a non BMI-stratified overall sample were performed. The former did not uncover any novel locus with a major main effect, but supported modulation of effects for some known and potentially new urate loci. The latter highlighted a SNP at RBFOX3 reaching genome-wide significant level (effect size 0.014, 95% CI 0.008-0.02, Pinter= 2.6 x 10-8). Two top loci in interaction term analyses, RBFOX3 and ERO1LB-EDARADD, also displayed suggestive differences in main effect size between the lean and obese strata. All top ranking loci for urate effect differences between BMI categories were novel and most had small magnitude but opposite direction effects between strata. They include the locus RBMS1-TANK (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 4.7 x 10-8), a region that has been associated with several obesity related traits, and TSPYL5 (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 9.1 x 10-8), regulating adipocytes-produced estradiol. The top-ranking known urate loci was ABCG2, the strongest known gout risk locus, with an effect halved in obese compared to lean men (Pdifflean-obese= 2 x 10-4). Finally, pathway analysis suggested a role for N-glycan biosynthesis as a prominent urate-associated pathway in the lean stratum.

CECs are critical in maintaining corneal transparency through their barrier and pump functions. CECs in vivo have a limited capacity in proliferation, and loss of a significant number of CECs results in corneal edema called bullous keratopathy which can lead to severe visual loss. Corneal transplantation is the most effective method to treat corneal endothelial dysfunction, where it suffers from donor shortage. Therefore, regeneration of CECs from other cell types attracts increasing interests, and specific markers of CECs are crucial to identify actual CECs. However, the currently used markers are far from satisfactory because of their non-specific expression in other cell types. Here, we explored molecular markers to discriminate CECs from other cell types in the human body by integrating the published RNA-seq data of CECs and the FANTOM5 atlas representing diverse range of cell types based on expression patterns. We identified five genes, CLRN1, MRGPRX3, HTR1D, GRIP1 and ZP4 as novel markers of CECs, and the specificities of these genes were successfully confirmed by independent experiments at both the RNA and protein levels. Notably none of them have been documented in the context of CEC function. These markers could be useful for the purification of actual CECs, and also available for the evaluation of the products derived from other cell types.

This is in contrast to the United States, where infections are exclusively caused by B. burgdorferi. Until to date the genome sequences of four B. afzelii strains, of which only two include the numerous plasmids, are available. In order to further assess the genetic diversity of B. afzelii, the most common species in Europe, responsible for the large variety of clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, we have determined the full genome sequence of the B. afzelii strain K78, a clinical isolate from Austria. The K78 genome contains a linear chromosome (905,949 bp) and 13 plasmids (8 linear and 5 circular) together presenting 1,309 open reading frames of which 496 are located on plasmids. With the exception of lp28-8, all linear replicons in their full length including their telomeres have been sequenced. The comparison with the genomes of the four other B. afzelii strains, ACA-1, PKo, HLJ01 and Tom3107, as well as the one of B. burgdorferi strain B31, confirmed a high degree of conservation within the linear chromosome of B. afzelii, whereas plasmid encoded genes showed a much larger diversity. Since some plasmids present in B. burgdorferi are missing in the B. afzelii genomes, the corresponding virulence factors of B. burgdorferi are found in B. afzelii on other unrelated plasmids. In addition, we have identified a species specific region in the circular plasmid, cp26, which could be used for species determination.

Most members have mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. PARP13/ARTD13, also called zinc finger antiviral protein, has roles in viral immunity and microRNA-mediated stress responses. PARP13 features a divergent PARP homology domain missing a PARP consensus sequence motif; the domain has enigmatic functions and apparently lacks catalytic activity. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical analyses to investigate the structural requirements for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in human PARP13 and two of its functional partners in stress granules: PARP12/ARTD12, and PARP15/BAL3/ARTD7. The crystal structure of the PARP homology domain of PARP13 shows obstruction of the canonical active site, precluding NAD(+) binding. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this closed cleft conformation is maintained in solution. Introducing consensus side chains in PARP13 did not result in 3-aminobenzamide binding, but in further closure of the site.

In total 2775 proteins from P. pisi and 2891 proteins from P. sojae were identified.

ISs are proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes. Our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant (the water fern Azolla), revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of insertion sequences (ISs) together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes. To investigate the role of ISs in the reductive evolution of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of the IS identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was conducted. To widen the scope, the IS contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing both free-living and symbiotic bacteria.\n\nInsertion Sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location (\"local hopping\") and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of IS elements. In general, symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of IS elements and pseudogenes than non-symbiotic bacteria. A total of 1108 distinct repeated sequences over 500\u00a0bp were identified in the 67 genomes investigated. In the genome of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, IS elements were apparent at 970 locations (14.3%), with 428 being full-length. Morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of IS elements, irrespective of life style.\n\nThe apparent co-location of IS elements and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier IS transpositions into genes. As transpositions tend to be local rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity between IS elements and pseudogenes.

Furthermore, we observed an increased acidification in synaptic vesicles isolated from mice overexpressing SLC10A4. Loss of SLC10A4 in mice resulted in reduced striatal serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine concentrations and a significantly higher dopamine turnover ratio. Absence of SLC10A4 led to slower dopamine clearance rates in vivo, which resulted in accumulation of extracellular dopamine. Finally, whereas SLC10A4 null mutant mice were slightly hypoactive, they displayed hypersensitivity to administration of amphetamine and tranylcypromine.\n\nOur results demonstrate that SLC10A4 is a vesicular monoaminergic and cholinergic associated transporter that is important for dopamine homeostasis and neuromodulation in vivo.

Despite these important insights, the rate and processes governing the earliest stages of diploidization remain poorly understood, and the relative importance of genetic drift, positive selection, and relaxed purifying selection in the process of gene degeneration and loss is unclear. Here, we conduct whole-genome resequencing in Capsella bursa-pastoris, a recently formed tetraploid with one of the most widespread species distributions of any angiosperm. Whole-genome data provide strong support for recent hybrid origins of the tetraploid species within the past 100,000-300,000 y from two diploid progenitors in the Capsella genus. Major-effect inactivating mutations are frequent, but many were inherited from the parental species and show no evidence of being fixed by positive selection.

Our results suggest that the earliest stages of diploidization are associated with quantitative genome-wide decreases in the strength and efficacy of selection rather than rapid gene loss, and that nonfunctionalization can receive a \"head start\" through a legacy of deleterious variants and differential expression originating in parental diploid populations.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1412277112", "pmid": "25691747", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1412277112"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4352811"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8c8a288f676945c4beab4e0a502b75aa.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8c8a288f676945c4beab4e0a502b75aa"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7e7dd1c9a9e64925b730afad2cc79c29", "title": "Proteomic profiling reveals autoimmune targets in sarcoidosis.", "authors": [{"family": "H\u00e4ggmark", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Carl", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Wiklundh", "given": "Emil", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lindskog", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Eni", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Ingrid E", "initials": "IE"}, {"family": "Gr\u00f6nlund", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Eklund", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Grunewald", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-03-01", "journal": {"volume": "191", "issn": "1535-4970", "issue": "5", "pages": "574-583", "title": "Am.

A total of 188 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with poor prognostic features (unmutated IGHV, n=137; IGHV3-21 subset #2, n=51) were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 and data were analyzed using well-established bioinformatics tools. Using a conservative cutoff of 10% for the mutant allele, we found that 114/180 (63%) patients carried at least one mutation, with mutations in ATM, BIRC3, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 accounting for 149/177 (84%) of all mutations. We selected 155 mutations for Sanger validation (variant allele frequency, 10-99%) and 93% (144/155) of mutations were confirmed; notably, all 11 discordant variants had a variant allele frequency between 11-27%, hence at the detection limit of conventional Sanger sequencing.

Mutations in components of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) pathway have previously been associated with FADS.\n\nWe report on a family with recurrent fetal loss, where the parents had five affected fetuses/children with FADS and one healthy child. The fetuses displayed no fetal movements from the gestational age of 17\u2005weeks, extended knee joints, flexed hips and elbows, and clenched hands. Whole exome sequencing of one affected fetus and the parents was performed. A novel homozygous frameshift mutation was identified in muscle, skeletal receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), c.40dupA, which segregated with FADS in the family. Haplotype analysis revealed a conserved haplotype block suggesting a founder mutation. MuSK (muscle-specific tyrosine kinase receptor), a component of the AChR pathway, is a main regulator of neuromuscular junction formation and maintenance. Missense mutations in MuSK have previously been reported to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) associated with AChR deficiency.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a mutation in MuSK is associated with FADS. The results support previous findings that CMS and/or FADS are caused by complete or severe functional disruption of components located in the AChR pathway.

The crystal structure of the H. orenii glycosidase was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.10\u2005\u00c5 resolution. As for other GH43 members, the enzyme folds as a five-bladed \u03b2-propeller. The structure features a metal-binding site on the propeller axis, near the active site. Based on thermal denaturation data, the H. orenii glycosidase depends on divalent cations in combination with high salt for optimal thermal stability against unfolding. A maximum melting temperature of 76\u00b0C was observed in the presence of 4\u2005M NaCl and Mn(2+) at pH 6.5. The gene encoding the H. orenii GH43 enzyme has previously been annotated as a putative \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase. Activity was detected with p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranoside as a substrate, and therefore the name HoAraf43 was suggested for the enzyme. In agreement with the conditions for optimal thermal stability against unfolding, the highest arabinofuranosidase activity was obtained in the presence of 4\u2005M NaCl and Mn(2+) at pH 6.5, giving a specific activity of 20-36\u2005\u00b5mol\u2005min(-1)\u2005mg(-1). The active site is structurally distinct from those of other GH43 members, including arabinanases, arabinofuranosidases and xylanases.

EOMES is a T-box transcription factor that is involved in mesoderm specification during gastrulation. In D*V and D*C chicken embryos we find that EOMES is ectopically expressed in the ectoderm of the comb-developing region as compared to wild-type embryos. The confinement of the ectopic expression of EOMES to the ectoderm is in stark contrast to the causal mechanisms underlying the two other major comb loci in the chicken (Rose-comb and Pea-comb) in which the transcription factors MNR2 and SOX5 are ectopically expressed strictly in the mesenchyme. Interestingly, the causal mutations of all three major comb loci in the chicken are now known to be composed of large-scale structural genomic variants that each result in ectopic expression of transcription factors. The Duplex-comb locus also illustrates the evolution of alleles in domestic animals, which means that alleles evolve by the accumulation of two or more consecutive mutations affecting the phenotype.

In fft3\u2206 cells, subtelomeres lose their association with the LEM domain protein Man1 at the nuclear periphery and move to the interior of the nucleus.

Automatic analysis of user-defined sequences is performed, and probes specifically designed for metagenome studies are generated. To illustrate the advantage of a targeted metagenome approach, we have generated more than 400,000 probes that match more than 300,000 [corrected] publicly available sequences related to carbon degradation, and used these probes for target sequencing in a soil metagenome study. The results show high enrichment of target genes and a successful capturing of the majority of gene families.

Thus, our findings may form the basis for further investigations to unravel the molecular effects of gastric bypass surgery.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01730742.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0115186", "pmid": "25710379", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-14-30004"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4340013"}, {"db": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "key": "NCT01730742"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a6765b37043e400396ea7a414e8b3191.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a6765b37043e400396ea7a414e8b3191"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0084e4159de44394afe90353965e1bb6", "title": "The roles of SNF2/SWI2 nucleosome remodeling enzymes in blood cell differentiation and leukemia.", "authors": [{"family": "Prasad", "given": "Punit", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Lennartsson", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ekwall", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-02-19", "journal": {"volume": "2015", "issn": "2314-6141", "issue": null, "pages": "347571", "title": "Biomed Res Int"}, "abstract": "Here, we review the role of sucrose nonfermenting (SNF2) family enzymes in blood cell development. The SNF2 family comprises helicase-like ATPases, originally discovered in yeast, that can remodel chromatin by changing chromatin structure and composition. The human genome encodes 30 different SNF2 enzymes. SNF2 family enzymes are often part of multisubunit chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs), which consist of noncatalytic/auxiliary subunit along with the ATPase subunit. However, blood cells express a limited set of SNF2 ATPases that are necessary to maintain the pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and drive normal blood cell development and differentiation. The composition of CRCs can be altered by the association of specific auxiliary subunits. Several auxiliary CRC subunits have specific functions in hematopoiesis. Aberrant expressions of SNF2 ATPases and/or auxiliary CRC subunit(s) are often observed in hematological malignancies. Using large-scale data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) we observed frequent mutations in genes encoding SNF2 helicase-like enzymes and auxiliary CRC subunits in leukemia. Hence, orderly function of SNF2 family enzymes is crucial for the execution of normal blood cell developmental program, and defects in chromatin remodeling caused by mutations or aberrant expression of these proteins may contribute to leukemogenesis.", "doi": "10.1155/2015/347571", "pmid": "25789315", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4348595"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0084e4159de44394afe90353965e1bb6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0084e4159de44394afe90353965e1bb6"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "70d67f68009941728bedd013f652952b", "title": "Evolution of Darwin's finches and their beaks revealed by genome sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Lamichhaney", "given": "Sangeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Berglund", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alm\u00e9n", "given": "Markus S\u00e4llman", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Maqbool", "given": "Khurram", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Grabherr", "given": "Manfred", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Martinez-Barrio", "given": "Alvaro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Promerov\u00e1", "given": "Marta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rubin", "given": "Carl-Johan", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Chao", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zamani", "given": "Neda", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Grant", "given": "B Rosemary", "initials": "BR"}, {"family": "Grant", "given": "Peter R", "initials": "PR"}, {"family": "Webster", "given": "Matthew T", "initials": "MT"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-02-19", "journal": {"volume": "518", "issn": "1476-4687", "issue": "7539", "pages": "371-375", "title": "Nature"}, "abstract": "Darwin's finches, inhabiting the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago and Cocos Island, constitute an iconic model for studies of speciation and adaptive evolution.

The primary aim of our study was to improve risk stratification of ALL patients into treatment groups using DNA methylation as a complement to current diagnostic methods. A secondary aim was to gain insight into the functional role of DNA methylation in ALL.\n\nWe used the methylation status of ~450,000 CpG sites in 546 well-characterized patients with T-ALL or seven recurrent B-cell precursor ALL subtypes to design and validate sensitive and accurate DNA methylation classifiers. After repeated cross-validation, a final classifier was derived that consisted of only 246 CpG sites. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the classifier across the known subtypes was 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. We then used DNA methylation classification to screen for subtype membership of 210 patients with undefined karyotype (normal or no result) or non-recurrent cytogenetic aberrations ('other' subtype). Nearly half (n\u2009=\u2009106) of the patients lacking cytogenetic subgrouping displayed highly similar methylation profiles as the patients in the known recurrent groups. We verified the subtype of 20% of the newly classified patients by examination of diagnostic karyotypes, array-based copy number analysis, and detection of fusion genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Using RNA-seq data from ALL patients where cytogenetic subtype and DNA methylation classification did not agree, we discovered several novel fusion genes involving ETV6, RUNX1, and PAX5.\n\nOur findings indicate that DNA methylation profiling contributes to the clarification of the heterogeneity in cytogenetically undefined ALL patient groups and could be implemented as a complementary method for diagnosis of ALL.

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for \u223c2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation.

Thus screening for BCR-ABL1 mutations is recommended particularly in patients experiencing poor response to treatment. Herein we describe a novel approach for the detection and surveillance of BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML patients.\n\nTo detect mutations in the BCR-ABL1 transcript we developed an assay based on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing technology, which allows for single-molecule long-read sequencing of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript molecules. Samples from six patients with poor response to therapy were analyzed both at diagnosis and follow-up. cDNA was generated from total RNA and a 1,6\u00a0kb fragment encompassing the BCR-ABL1 transcript was amplified using long range PCR. To estimate the sensitivity of the assay, a serial dilution experiment was performed.\n\nOver 10,000 full-length BCR-ABL1 sequences were obtained for all samples studied. Through the serial dilution analysis, mutations in CML patient samples could be detected down to a level of at least 1%. Notably, the assay was determined to be sufficiently sensitive even in patients harboring a low abundance of BCR-ABL1 levels. The PacBio sequencing successfully identified all mutations seen by standard methods. Importantly, we identified several mutations that escaped detection by the clinical routine analysis. Resistance mutations were found in all but one of the patients. Due to the long reads afforded by PacBio sequencing, compound mutations present in the same molecule were readily distinguished from independent alterations arising in different molecules. Moreover, several transcript isoforms of the BCR-ABL1 transcript were identified in two of the CML patients. Finally, our assay allowed for a quick turn around time allowing samples to be reported upon within 2\u00a0days.\n\nIn summary the PacBio sequencing assay can be applied to detect BCR-ABL1 resistance mutations in both diagnostic and follow-up CML patient samples using a simple protocol applicable to routine diagnosis. The method besides its sensitivity, gives a complete view of the clonal distribution of mutations, which is of importance when making therapy decisions.", "doi": "10.1186/s12885-015-1046-y", "pmid":

Analysis of quantitative LC-MS/MS data is mainly performed in three major steps: processing of raw data, normalization, and statistical analysis.

Validating the new setups is a crucial part of conducting rigorous scientific research. Here we report on the reliability and biases of performing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We designed a protocol using 50 barcode pairs to run samples in parallel and coded a pipeline to process the data. Sequencing the same sediment sample in 248 replicates as well as 70 samples from alkaline soda lakes, we evaluated the performance of the method with regards to estimates of alpha and beta diversity. Using different purification and DNA quantification procedures we always found up to 5-fold differences in the yield of sequences between individually barcodes samples. Using either a one-step or a two-step PCR preparation resulted in significantly different estimates in both alpha and beta diversity. Comparing with a previous method based on 454 pyrosequencing, we found that our Illumina protocol performed in a similar manner - with the exception for evenness estimates where correspondence between the methods was low. We further quantified the data loss at every processing step eventually accumulating to 50% of the raw reads. When evaluating different OTU clustering methods, we observed a stark contrast between the results of QIIME with default settings and the more recent UPARSE algorithm when it comes to the number of OTUs generated. Still, overall trends in alpha and beta diversity corresponded highly using both clustering methods. Our procedure performed well considering the precisions of alpha and beta diversity estimates, with insignificant effects of individual barcodes. Comparative analyses suggest that 454 and Illumina sequence data can be combined if the same PCR protocol and bioinformatic workflows are used for describing patterns in richness, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0116955", "pmid": "25647581", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-14-40404"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4315398"}, {"db": "SRA", "key": "SRP044363"}, {"db": "SRA", "key": "SRP044627"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5403af82055d48e2804ad16ac507fb91.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5403af82055d48e2804ad16ac507fb91"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "32f6afce41e241e8846bea229aa96e6b", "title": "Risk of childhood asthma is associated with CpG-site polymorphisms, regional DNA methylation and mRNA levels at the GSDMB/ORMDL3 locus.", "authors": [{"family": "Acevedo", "given": "Nathalie", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Reinius", "given": "Lovisa E", "initials": "LE"}, {"family": "Greco", "given": "Dario", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gref", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Orsmark-Pietras", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Pershagen", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Hedlin", "given": "Gunilla", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mel\u00e9n", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Scheynius", "given": "Annika", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kere", "given": "Juha", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derh\u00e4ll", "given": "Cilla", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-02-01", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "1460-2083", "issue": "3", "pages": "875-890", "title": "Hum.

We investigated the effects of asthma-associated SNPs on DNA methylation and mRNA levels of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genetic association between GSDMB/ORMDL3 and physician-diagnosed childhood asthma was confirmed in the Swedish birth-cohort BAMSE. CpG-site SNPs (rs7216389 and rs4065275) showed differences in DNA methylation depending on carrier status of the risk alleles, and were significantly associated with methylation levels in two CpG sites in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of ORMDL3. In the Swedish Search study, we found significant differences in DNA methylation between asthmatics and controls in five CpG sites; after adjusting for lymphocyte and neutrophil cell counts, three remained significant: one in IKZF3 [IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos); cg16293631] and two in the CpG island (CGI) of ORMDL3 (cg02305874 and cg16638648). Also, cg16293631 and cg02305874 correlated with mRNA levels of ORMDL3. The association between methylation and asthma was independent of the genotype in rs7216389, rs4065275 and rs12603332. Both SNPs and CpG sites showed significant associations with ORMDL3 mRNA levels. SNPs influenced expression independently of methylation, and the residual association between methylation and expression was not mediated by these SNPs. We found a differentially methylated region in the CGI shore of ORMDL3 with six CpG sites less methylated in CD8(+) T-cells.

Only few antimycotics exist, often with severe side effects. Therefore, new antifungal drugs are urgently needed. Because the identification of antifungal compounds depends on fast and reliable assays, we present a new approach based on high-throughput image analysis to define cell morphology. Candida albicans and other fungi of the Candida clade switch between different growth morphologies, from budding yeast to filamentous hyphae. Yeasts are considered proliferative, whereas hyphae are required for invasion and dissemination. Thus, morphotype switching in many Candida spp. is connected to virulence and pathogenesis. It is, consequently, reasonable to presume that morphotype blockers interfere with the virulence, thereby preventing hazardous colonization. Our method efficiently differentiates yeast from hyphal cells using a combination of automated microscopy and image analysis. We selected the parameters length/width ratio and mean object shape to quantitatively discriminate yeasts and hyphae. Notably, Z' factor calculations for these parameters confirmed the suitability of our method for high-throughput screening. As a second stage, we determined cell viability to discriminate morphotype-switching inhibitors from those that are fungicidal.

Thus, it is of particular interest to identify improved enzymatic processes for lactose utilization. Microbial \u03b2-glucosidases (BGL) with significant \u03b2-galactosidase (BGAL) activity can be used to convert lactose to glucose (Glc) and galactose (Gal), and most retaining BGLs also synthesize more complex sugars from the monosaccharides by transglycosylation, such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), which are prebiotic compounds that stimulate growth of beneficial gut bacteria. In this work, a BGL from the thermophilic and halophilic bacterium Halothermothrix orenii, HoBGLA, was characterized biochemically and structurally. It is an unspecific \u03b2-glucosidase with mixed activities for different substrates and prominent activity with various galactosidases such as lactose. We show that HoBGLA is an attractive candidate for industrial lactose conversion based on its high activity and stability within a broad pH range (4.5-7.5), with maximal \u03b2-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0. The temperature optimum is in the range of 65-70\u00a0\u00b0C, and HoBGLA also shows excellent thermostability at this temperature range. The main GOS products from HoBGLA transgalactosylation are \u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u21926)-D-Lac (6GALA) and \u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u21923)-D-Lac (3GALA), indicating that D-lactose is a better galactosyl acceptor than either of the monosaccharides. To evaluate ligand binding and guide GOS modeling, crystal structures of HoBGLA were determined in complex with thiocellobiose, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and glucose. The two major GOS products, 3GALA and 6GALA, were modeled in the substrate-binding cleft of wild-type HoBGLA and shown to be favorably accommodated.", "doi": "10.1007/s00253-014-6015-x", "pmid": "25173693", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4322223"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/467320863c2247558ef4666ff32b70a8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/467320863c2247558ef4666ff32b70a8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "50dff19579e344408c432bd127027ff6", "title": "Proposal of Thorsellia kenyensis sp. nov. and Thorsellia kandunguensis sp. nov., isolated from larvae of Anopheles arabiensis, as members of the family Thorselliaceae fam. nov.", "authors": [{"family": "K\u00e4mpfer", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Glaeser", "given": "Stefanie P", "initials": "SP"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Louise K J", "initials": "LKJ"}, {"family": "Eberhard", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Guy", "given": "Lionel", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Roos", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Busse", "given": "Hans-J\u00fcrgen", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Terenius", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2015-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "65", "issn": "1466-5034", "issue": "Pt 2", "pages": "444-451", "title": "Int.

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, strains T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) were shown to belong to the genus Thorsellia, both showing 97.8 % similarity to the type strain of Thorsellia anophelis, with 98.1 % similarity to each other. Chemotaxonomic data supported the allocation of the strains to the genus Thorsellia: their major fatty acids were C18 : 1\u03c97c, C16 : 0 and C14 : 0 and they harboured a ubiquinone Q-8 quinone system and a polyamine pattern with the major compound 1,3-diaminopropane. Qualitative and quantitative differences in their polar lipid profiles distinguished strains T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) from each other and from T. anophelis. Average nucleotide identity (ANI), DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) as well as physiological and biochemical tests allowed T2.1(T) and W5.1.1(T) to be distinguished both genotypically and phenotypically from each other and from the type strain of T. anophelis.

The thickness and growth of the colon mucus were similar in the two colonies. However, one colony had mucus that was impenetrable to bacteria or beads the size of bacteria-which is comparable to what we observed in free-living wild mice-whereas the other colony had an inner mucus layer penetrable to bacteria and beads. The different properties of the mucus depended on the microbiota, as they were transmissible by transfer of caecal microbiota to germ-free mice. Mice with an impenetrable mucus layer had increased amounts of Erysipelotrichi, whereas mice with a penetrable mucus layer had higher levels of Proteobacteria and TM7 bacteria in the distal colon mucus. Thus, our study shows that bacteria and their community structure affect mucus barrier properties in ways that can have implications for health and disease.

Despite this, systematic functional categorization of cleavage performance has largely been lacking. We established a simple and automatable model system to assay cleavage distance variation (termed slippage) and the sequence dependence thereof. We coupled this to massively parallel sequencing in order to provide sensitive and accurate measurement. With this system 14 enzymes were assayed (AcuI, BbvI, BpmI, BpuEI, BseRI, BsgI, Eco57I, Eco57MI, EcoP15I, FauI, FokI, GsuI, MmeI and SmuI).

Here, we show that systems biology approaches can uncover mechanisms underlying cellular responses to nanomaterials. Using RNA Seq and computational approaches, we found that cationic poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM-NH2) are capable of triggering down-regulation of cell-cycle-related genes in primary human bronchial epithelial cells at doses that do not elicit acute cytotoxicity, as demonstrated using conventional cell viability assays, while gene transcription was not affected by neutral PAMAM-OH dendrimers. The PAMAMs were internalized in an active manner by lung cells and localized mainly in lysosomes; amine-terminated dendrimers were internalized more efficiently when compared to the hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers. Upstream regulator analysis implicated NF-\u03baB as a putative transcriptional regulator, and subsequent cell-based assays confirmed that PAMAM-NH2 caused NF-\u03baB-dependent cell cycle arrest. However, PAMAM-NH2 did not affect cell cycle progression in the human A549 adenocarcinoma cell line.

By analysis of multiple tumour samples from seven patients we demonstrate intratumoral diversity in all patients analysed after chemotherapy, typically presenting as multiple clones within a single millimetre-sized tumour sample (microdiversity). We show that microdiversity often acts as the foundation for further genome evolution in metastases. In addition, we find that microdiversity predicts poor cancer-specific survival (60%; P=0.009), independent of other risk factors, in a cohort of 44 patients with chemotherapy-treated childhood kidney cancer.

Given the fact that pro-metastatic cancer cells share a unique capacity with immune cells to traffic in-and-out of blood and lymphatic vessels we hypothesized that tumor cells undergoing EMT may acquire properties of immune cells. To study this, we performed gene-profiling analysis of mouse mammary EpRas tumor cells that had been allowed to adopt an EMT program after long-term treatment with TGF-\u03b21 for 2\u2009weeks.

Causal mechanisms between estimates of renal function and CVD are intricate and investigation of the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for the variability of these phenotypes could provide new knowledge.\n\nCystatin C and creatinine levels in 12 313 twins were analyzed. Uni- and bivariate heritability for these traits and CVD was estimated through structured equation modelling and genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) in order to independently confirm additive genetic effects. Twin model-estimated heritability of Cystatin C was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.60) in men, 0.63 (0.59 to 0.66) in women, and 0.60 (0.56 to 0.63) in both sexes combined.

Here, we report on the genome sequencing of C. rosea and a comparative genome analysis, in order to resolve the phylogenetic placement of C. rosea and to study the evolution of mycoparasitism as a fungal lifestyle. The genome of C. rosea is estimated to 58.3 Mb, and contains 14,268 predicted genes. A phylogenomic analysis shows that C. rosea clusters as sister taxon to plant pathogenic Fusarium species, with mycoparasitic/saprotrophic Trichoderma species in an ancestral position. A comparative analysis of gene family evolution reveals several distinct differences between the included mycoparasites. Clonostachys rosea contains significantly more ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, polyketide synthases, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, pectin lyases, glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductases, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases compared with other fungi in the Hypocreales. Interestingly, the increase of ABC transporter gene number in C. rosea is associated with phylogenetic subgroups B (multidrug resistance proteins) and G (pleiotropic drug resistance transporters), whereas an increase in subgroup C (multidrug resistance-associated proteins) is evident in Trichoderma virens. In contrast with mycoparasitic Trichoderma species, C. rosea contains very few chitinases. Expression of six group B and group G ABC transporter genes was induced in C. rosea during exposure to the Fusarium mycotoxin zearalenone, the fungicide Boscalid or metabolites from the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis.

and insulin (FI) have identified common variant signals which explain 4.8% and 1.2% of trait variance, respectively. It is hypothesized that low-frequency and rare variants could contribute substantially to unexplained genetic variance. To test this, we analyzed exome-array data from up to 33,231 non-diabetic individuals of European ancestry. We found exome-wide significant (P<5\u00d710-7) evidence for two loci not previously highlighted by common variant GWAS: GLP1R (p.Ala316Thr, minor allele frequency (MAF)=1.5%) influencing FG levels, and URB2 (p.Glu594Val, MAF = 0.1%) influencing FI levels. Coding variant associations can highlight potential effector genes at (non-coding) GWAS signals. At the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus, we identified multiple coding variants in G6PC2 (p.Val219Leu, p.His177Tyr, and p.Tyr207Ser) influencing FG levels, conditionally independent of each other and the non-coding GWAS signal. In vitro assays demonstrate that these associated coding alleles result in reduced protein abundance via proteasomal degradation, establishing G6PC2 as an effector gene at this locus. Reconciliation of single-variant associations and functional effects was only possible when haplotype phase was considered. In contrast to earlier reports suggesting that, paradoxically, glucose-raising alleles at this locus are protective against type 2 diabetes (T2D), the p.Val219Leu G6PC2 variant displayed a modest but directionally consistent association with T2D risk. Coding variant associations for glycemic traits in GWAS signals highlight PCSK1, RREB1, and ZHX3 as likely effector transcripts.

At the persistent stage, the expression pattern in many respects resembles the pattern seen in vitro at 26oC, with for example, up-regulation of flagellar genes and invA. These findings are expected to have impact on future rationales to identify suitable bacterial targets for new antibiotics. Other genes that are up-regulated during persistence are genes involved in anaerobiosis, chemotaxis, and protection against oxidative and acidic stress, which indicates the influence of different environmental cues.

Employing the Random Forest method, we were able to predict whether a drug binds to a soluble or membrane protein with an average accuracy of 84\u2009% and an average area under curve of 0.91. The high average performance suggests that there exist some general physico-chemical differences between drugs that bind to membrane and soluble protein targets.

This resulted in six outstanding descriptors, that all involve drug flexibility and lipophilicity, suggesting that drugs binding to membrane protein targets are in general more flexible and lipophilic, and conversely, drugs binding to soluble protein targets are more rigid and hydrophilic.

To extend the spectrum of known somatic variants in ALL, we performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of three B-cell precursor patients, of which one carried the t(12;21)ETV6-RUNX1 translocation and two lacked a known primary genetic aberration, and one T-ALL patient. We found that each patient had a unique genome, with a combination of well-known and previously undetected genomic aberrations. By targeted sequencing in 168 patients, we identified KMT2D and KIF1B as novel putative driver genes. We also identified a putative regulatory non-coding variant that coincided with overexpression of the growth factor MDK. Our results contribute to an increased understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to ALL and suggest that regulatory variants may be more important for cancer development than recognized to date. The heterogeneity of the genetic aberrations in ALL renders whole genome sequencing particularly well suited for analysis of somatic variants in both research and diagnostic applications.", "doi": "10.1002/humu.22719", "pmid": "25355294", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4309499"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f7137ce4885d4146a3a441a85cda9673.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f7137ce4885d4146a3a441a85cda9673"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "07ab5334ad1c4c69b747daedb63da604", "title": "Anti-Obesity Effects and Metabolism in DIO Mice of a Novel Hybrid Lipid with Lauric and Lipoic Acid", "authors": [{"family": "Madawala", "given": "Samanthi RP", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Manubolu", "given": "Manjunath", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Asp", "given": "Michaela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gokturk", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Malml\u00f6f", "given": "Kjell", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dutta", "given": "Paresh C", "initials": "PC"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-00-00", "journal": {"volume": "05", "issn": "2165-7904", "issue": "02", "pages": null, "title": "J Obes Weight Loss Ther"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.4172/2165-7904.1000256", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/07ab5334ad1c4c69b747daedb63da604.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/07ab5334ad1c4c69b747daedb63da604"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "178c90e4a2274388aae2d784481970f6", "title": "Cytotoxicity, in Vivo Skin Irritation and Acute Systemic Toxicity of the Mesoporous Magnesium Carbonate Upsalite", "authors": [{"family": "Frykstrand", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Forsgren", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Peng", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Str\u00f8mme", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ferraz", "given": "Natalia", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-00-00", "journal": {"volume": "06", "issn": "2158-7027", "issue": "04", "pages": "257-266", "title": "JBNB"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.4236/jbnb.2015.64024", "pmid": null, "labels": {"BioMaterial Interactions (BioMat)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/178c90e4a2274388aae2d784481970f6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/178c90e4a2274388aae2d784481970f6"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c65d5d5b7997446eb833393f6ca5c0c5", "title": "Pd-catalyzed C\u2013N coupling of vinylbromides and sulfonimidamides: a facile synthesis of N\u2032-vinylsulfonimidamides", "authors": [{"family": "Nandi", "given": "Ganesh C", "initials": "GC"}, {"family": "Kota", "given": "Sudhakar R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Wakchaure", "given": "Prasad B", "initials": "PB"}, {"family": "Chinthakindi", "given": "Praveen K", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Govender", "given": "Thavendran", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Kruger", "given": "Hendrick G", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Naicker", "given": "Tricia", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Arvidsson", "given": "Per I", "initials": "PI"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2015-00-00", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2046-2069", "issue": "76", "pages": "62084-62090", "title": "RSC Adv."}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1039/c5ra10939f", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Drug Discovery and Development (DDD)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c65d5d5b7997446eb833393f6ca5c0c5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c65d5d5b7997446eb833393f6ca5c0c5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d1888a85f4cf4aa3b4bcf30a62dd5bed", "title": "The effect of N-methylation of amino acids (Ac-X-OMe) on solubility and conformation: a DFT study", "authors": [{"family": "Md.
