Infectious viruses contribute to tumorigenesis in a significant fraction of human neoplasias.\n\nCharacterize inflammatory infiltrates and possible viral transcription in primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nFrom the period 2007 to 2016, a total of 55 parathyroid tumors (51 adenomas and 4 hyperplasias) with prominent inflammatory infiltrates were identified from more than 2000 parathyroid tumors in the pathology archives, and investigated by immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD45 and scored as +0, +1 or +2. Clinicopathological data were compared to 142 parathyroid adenomas without histological evidence of inflammation. Transcriptome sequencing was performed for 13 parathyroid tumors (four inflammatory, 9 non-inflammatory) to identify potential viral transcripts.\n\nTumors had prominent germinal center-like nodular (+2) lymphocytic infiltrates consisting of T and B lymphocytes (31%) and/or diffuse (+1-2) infiltrates of predominantly CD8+ T lymphocytes (84%). In the majority of cases with adjacent normal parathyroid tissue, the normal rim was unaffected by the inflammatory infiltrates (96%). Presence of inflammatory infiltrates was associated with higher levels of serum-PTH (P\u2005=\u20050.007) and oxyphilic differentiation (P\u2005=\u20050.002). Co-existent autoimmune disease was observed in 27% of patients with inflammatory infiltrates, which in turn was associated with oxyphilic differentiation (P\u2005=\u20050.041). Additionally, prescription of anti-inflammatory drugs was associated with lower serum ionized calcium (P\u2005=\u20050.037).\n\nNo evidence of virus-like sequences in the parathyroid tumors could be found by transcriptome sequencing, suggesting that other factors may contribute to attract the immune system to the parathyroid tumor tissue.", "doi": "10.1530/EJE-17-0277", "pmid": "28855268",

economically important intestinal parasite responsible for increased food consumption, reduced performance and elevated mortality in commercial poultry production. This roundworm is an emerging problem in several European countries on farms with laying hens, as a consequence of the recent European Union (EU) ban on conventional battery cages. As infection is associated with slow development of low levels of acquired protective immunity, parasite control relies on repeated use of dewormers (anthelmintics). Benzimidazoles (BZ) are currently the only anthelmintic registered in the EU for use in controlling A. galli and there is an obvious risk of overuse of one drug class, selecting for resistance. Thus we developed a reference transcriptome of A. galli to investigate the response in gene expression before and after exposure to the BZ drug flubendazole (FLBZ). Transcriptional variations between treated and untreated A. galli showed that transcripts annotated as mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 were significantly down-regulated in treated worms, whereas transcripts homologous to heat shock proteins (HSP), catalase, phosphofructokinase, and a multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (PGP1) were significantly up-regulated in treated worms. Investigation of candidate transcripts responsible for anthelmintic resistance in livestock nematodes led to identification of several tubulins, including six new isoforms of beta-tubulin, and several ligand-gated ionotropic receptors and ABC-transporters. We discovered several transcripts associated with drug binding and processing genes, but further characterisation using a larger set of worms exposed to BZs in functional assays is required to determine how these are involved in drug binding and metabolism.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0185182", "pmid": "29099835", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-17-16106"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ecc7551bf07d4ecf930ff13d013aeee3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ecc7551bf07d4ecf930ff13d013aeee3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0cd49b807b98485fb62dcca6a680aa25", "title": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks For Detecting Cellular Changes Due To Malignancy", "authors": [{"family": "Wieslander", "given": "H\u00e5kan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Forslid", "given": "Gustav", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bengtsson", "given": "Ewert", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "W\u00e4hlby", "given": "Carolina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hirsch", "given": "Jan-Micha\u00e9l", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Runow Stark", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kecheril Sadanandan", "given": "Sajith", "initials": "S"}], "type": null, "published": "2017-11-01", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": null, "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017"}, "abstract": "Discovering cancer at an early stage is an effective way to increase the chance of survival. However, since most screening processes are done manually it is time inef\ufb01cient and thus a costly process. One way of automizing the screening process could be to classify cells using Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks have been proven to be accurate for image classi\ufb01cation tasks. Two datasets containing oral cells and two datasets containing cervical cells were used. For the cervical cancer dataset the cells were classi\ufb01ed by medical experts as normal or abnormal. For the oral cell dataset we only used the diagnosis of the patient. All cells obtained from a patient with malignancy were thus considered malignant even though most of them looked normal. The performance was evaluated for two different network architectures, ResNet and VGG. For the oral datasets the accuracy varied between 78-82% correctly classi\ufb01ed cells depending on the dataset and network.

Here, we highlight the impact of uncontrolled discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewater on the structure of bacterial communities and resistome of sediments collected from Mutha river flowing through Pune city in India. Using shotgun metagenomics, we found a wide array (n\u00a0=\u00a0175) of horizontally transferable antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including carbapenemases such as NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP types. The relative abundance of total ARGs was 30-fold higher in river sediments within the city compared to upstream sites. Forty four ARGs, including the tet(X) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline, OXA-58 and GES type carbapenemases, were significantly more abundant in city sediments, while two ARGs were more common at upstream sites. The recently identified mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was detected only in one of the upstream samples, but not in city samples. In addition to ARGs, higher abundances of various mobile genetic elements were found in city samples, including integron-associated integrases and ISCR transposases, as well as some biocide/metal resistance genes. Virulence toxin genes as well as bacterial genera comprising many pathogens were more abundant here; the genus Acinetobacter, which is often associated with multidrug resistance and nosocomial infections, comprised up to 29% of the 16S rRNA reads, which to our best knowledge is unmatched in any other deeply sequenced metagenome. There was a strong correlation between the abundance of Acinetobacter and the OXA-58 carbapenemase gene.

These data represent a basic resource for clinical genetics laboratories as well as for sequencing-based association studies by providing information on genetic variant frequencies in a cohort that is well matched to national patient cohorts. To select samples for this study, we first examined the genetic structure of the Swedish population using high-density SNP-array data from a nation-wide cohort of over 10\u2009000 Swedish-born individuals included in the Swedish Twin Registry. A total of 1000 individuals, reflecting a cross-section of the population and capturing the main genetic structure, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Analysis pipelines were developed for automated alignment, variant calling and quality control of the sequencing data. This resulted in a genome-wide collection of aggregated variant frequencies in the Swedish population that we have made available to the scientific community through the website https://swefreq.nbis.se. A total of 29.2 million single-nucleotide variants and 3.8 million indels were detected in the 1000 samples, with 9.9 million of these variants not present in current databases.

It consists of two FKBP12 like active peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains (an active FK1 and inactive FK2 domain) and one tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that mediates interaction with Hsp90 via its C-terminal MEEVD peptide.

The results demonstrated that the Hsp90 C-terminal peptide binds to the TPR domain of FKBP51 with the help of di-carboxylate clamp involving Lys272, Glu273, Lys352, Asn322, and Lys329 which are conserved throughout several di-carboxylate clamp TPR proteins.

We introduce a novel dual cure polymer resin for the formation of microfluidic gaskets that can be room-temperature bonded to a range of substrates using only UVA light. This polymer is the first polymer that features over a month of shelf life between the structure formation and the bonding, moreover the fully cured polymer gaskets feature the following set of properties suitable for microfluidics: high stiffness, which prevents microfluidic channel collapse during handling; very limited absorption of biomolecules; and no significant leaching of uncured monomers. We describe the novel polymer resin and its characteristics, study through FT-IR, and demonstrate its use as microfluidic well-arrays bonded onto protein array slides at room temperature followed by multiplexed immunoassays. The results confirm maintained biological activity and show high repeatability between protein arrays.

Here we use whole-genome resequencing of both allopatric and hybridising populations of the European (Phylloscopus collybita abietinus) and the Siberian chiffchaff (P. tristis) - two recently diverged species which differ in morphology, plumage, song, habitat and migration - to quantify the regional variation in genome-wide genetic diversity and differentiation and to identify candidate regions for trait variation. We find that the levels of diversity, differentiation and divergence are highly heterogeneous with significantly reduced global differentiation and more pronounced differentiation peaks in sympatry than in allopatry. This pattern is consistent with regional differences in effective population size and recurrent background selection or selective sweeps reducing the genetic diversity in specific regions prior to lineage divergence, but the data also suggest that post-divergence selection has resulted in increased differentiation and fixed differences in specific regions. We find that hybridization and backcrossing is common in sympatry and that phenotype is a poor predictor of the genomic composition of sympatric birds.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on plasma protein profiles by delayed centrifugation and plasma separation and multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Methods Blood samples drawn from 16 healthy individuals were collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and kept either at 4 \u00b0C or 22 \u00b0C for 1-36 h prior to centrifugation. Plasma samples prepared 1 h after venipuncture were also subjected to two to eight cycles of freezing at -80 \u00b0C and thawing at 22 \u00b0C. Multiplex proximity extension assay, an antibody-based protein assay, was used to investigate the influence on plasma proteins. Results Up to 36 h delay before blood centrifugation resulted in significant increases of 16 and 40 out of 139 detectable proteins in samples kept at 4 \u00b0C or 22 \u00b0C, respectively. Some increases became noticeable after 8 h delay at 4 \u00b0C but already after 1 h at 22 \u00b0C. For samples stored at 4 \u00b0C, epidermal growth factor (EGF), NF-kappa-B essential modulator, SRC, interleukin 16 and CD6 increased the most, whereas the five most significantly increased proteins after storage at 22 \u00b0C were CD40 antigen ligand (CD40-L), EGF, platelet-derived growth factor subunit B, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Only matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) decreased significantly over time and only after storage at 22 \u00b0C.

There has been a widespread increase in hypoxia in coastal systems (referred to as 'dead zones') mainly caused by eutrophication. Hence, it is central to understand the metabolism and ecology of eukaryotic life in sediments during changing oxygen conditions. Therefore, we sampled coastal 'dead zone' Baltic Sea sediment during autumn and spring, and analysed the eukaryotic metatranscriptome from field samples and after incubation in the dark under oxic or anoxic conditions. Bacillariophyta (diatoms) dominated the eukaryotic metatranscriptome in spring and were also abundant during autumn. A large fraction of the diatom RNA reads was associated with the photosystems suggesting a constitutive expression in darkness. Microscope observation showed intact diatom cells and these would, if hatched, represent a significant part of the pelagic phytoplankton biomass. Oxygenation did not significantly change the relative proportion of diatoms nor resulted in any major shifts in metabolic 'signatures'. By contrast, diatoms rapidly responded when exposed to light suggesting that light is limiting diatom development in hypoxic sediments. Hence, it is suggested that diatoms in hypoxic sediments are on 'standby' to exploit the environment if they reach suitable habitats.", "doi": "10.1098/rspb.2017.1617", "pmid": "28978732", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "rspb.2017.1617"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5647304"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8407c40d77d04cb2bde84500f396cddc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8407c40d77d04cb2bde84500f396cddc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2bd73789ab074bedbd1b4bdade0c4cab", "title": "CRISPR/Cas9 screening using unique molecular identifiers.", "authors": [{"family": "Schmierer", "given": "Bernhard", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Botla", "given": "Sandeep K", "initials": "SK"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Jilin", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Turunen", "given": "Mikko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kivioja", "given": "Teemu", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Taipale", "given": "Jussi", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-10-09", "journal": {"volume": "13", "issn": "1744-4292", "issue": "10", "pages": "945", "title": "Mol.

A phylogenetic analysis confirms established relationships among species, but identifies previously unknown intraspecific structure within Leptidea lineages. The genome assembly of L. sinapis is one of the largest of any lepidopteran taxon so far (643\u2009Mb) and genome size is correlated with abundance of TEs, both in Lepidoptera in general and within Leptidea where L. juvernica from Kazakhstan has considerably larger genome size than any other Leptidea population. Specific TE subclasses have been active in different Lepidoptera lineages with a pronounced expansion of predominantly LINEs, DNA elements, and unclassified TEs in the Leptidea lineage after the split from other Pieridae. The rate of genome expansion in Leptidea in general has been in the range of four Mb/Million year (My), with an increase in a particular L. juvernica population to 72\u2009Mb/My.

We aimed to identify the biomarkers that best predicted long-term all-cause mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Methods In this prospective cohort study, 92 biomarkers were analysed in 847 consecutive patients from the V\u00e4stmanland Myocardial Infarction Study with a median follow-up of 6.9 years. Results The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age of the patients was 70 (11.8) years and 32.7% were female. Two hundred and seven patients had died after follow-up. The biomarkers most strongly linked to all-cause mortality were growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2). Cox regression analysis showed that GDF-15 (hazard ratio 1.25 per unit change, 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.53, p\u2009=\u20090.031) and TRAIL-R2 (hazard ratio 1.37 per unit change, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.67, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were independent predictors of long-term all-cause mortality after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, body mass index, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction, troponin I, estimated glomerular filtration rate, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein. The combination of GDF-15 and TRAIL-R2 with established risk factors and biomarkers showed a discriminating accuracy of separating survivors from non-survivors with a cross-validated area under the receiving operating characteristics curve of 0.88 within five years.

Consequently, PDAC is a prime candidate for the use of sequencing to identify causative mutations, facilitating subsequent administration of targeted therapy. In a feasibility study, we retrospectively assessed the therapeutic recommendations of a novel, evidence-based software that analyzes next-generation sequencing (NGS) data using a large panel of pharmacogenomic biomarkers for efficacy and toxicity. Tissue from 14 patients with PDAC was sequenced using NGS with a 620 gene panel. FASTQ files were fed into treatmentmap. The results were compared with chemotherapy in the patients, including all side effects. No changes in therapy were made. Known driver mutations for PDAC were confirmed (e.g. KRAS, TP53). Software analysis revealed positive biomarkers for predicted effective and ineffective treatments in all patients. At least one biomarker associated with increased toxicity could be detected in all patients. Patients had been receiving one of the currently approved chemotherapy agents. In two patients, toxicity could have been correctly predicted by the software analysis. The results suggest that NGS, in combination with an evidence-based software, could be conducted within a 2-week period, thus being feasible for clinical routine. Therapy recommendations were principally off-label use. Based on the predominant KRAS mutations, other drugs were predicted to be ineffective. The pharmacogenomic biomarkers indicative of increased toxicity could be retrospectively linked to reported negative side effects in the respective patients. Finally, the occurrence of somatic and germline mutations in cancer syndrome-associated genes is noteworthy, despite a high frequency of these particular variants in the background population. These results suggest software-analysis of NGS data provides evidence-based information on effective, ineffective and toxic drugs, potentially forming the basis for precision cancer medicine in PDAC.", "doi": "10.1002/1878-0261.12108", "pmid": "28675654", "labels": {"Clinical Genomics Stockholm": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5623817"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b579fa6a62344afa63ce461a7ce0be5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b579fa6a62344afa63ce461a7ce0be5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b148b3bf70084c098378e646450f7a87", "title": "Detection of Post-Translational Modifications Using Solid-Phase Proximity Ligation Assay", "authors": [{"family": "Oliveira", "given": "Felipe Marques Souza de", "initials": "FMSd"}, {"family": "Mereiter", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "L\u00f6nn", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Siart", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Shen", "given": "Qiujin", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Heldin", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Raykova", "given": "Doroteya", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Niclas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Polom", "given": "Karol", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Roviello", "given": "Franco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Reis", "given": "Celso A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Kamali-Moghaddam", "given": "Masood", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-10-00", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "1871-6784", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "New Biotechnology"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.nbt.2017.10.005", "pmid": null, "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b148b3bf70084c098378e646450f7a87.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b148b3bf70084c098378e646450f7a87"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bdd67e281a7b45e8ae66b45cc2a1eb36", "title": "Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 and 2 Are Associated With Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage.", "authors": [{"family": "Svensson", "given": "Edith H", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derholm", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Abul-Kasim", "given": "Kasim", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Engstr\u00f6m", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "48", "issn": "1524-4628", "issue": "10", "pages": "2710-2715", "title": "Stroke"}, "abstract": "Raised plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR) have been linked to arterial stiffness, cerebral microbleeds, and vascular events.

Enhanced containment of replication was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages from a sub-group of BCG-vaccinated individuals (identified as 'responders'). A stable and robust differential DNA methylation pattern in response to BCG could be observed in PBMCs isolated from the responders but not from the non-responders.

The requirement for protein recognition by pairs of antibody conjugates can significantly improve specificity of protein detection over single-binder assays.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 22 September 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.102.", "doi": "10.1038/modpathol.2017.102", "pmid": "28937142", "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": "Technology development", "Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "modpathol2017102"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6d6d2546a79e49f9bd07debf8066d5be.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6d6d2546a79e49f9bd07debf8066d5be"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c6761f62f1d9488ca64f266cef67224a", "title": "Plasma stem cell factor levels are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and death", "authors": [{"family": "Bj\u00f6rkbacka", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Yao Mattisson", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Wigren", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Melander", "given": "O", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Fredrikson", "given": "G N", "initials": "GN"}, {"family": "Bengtsson", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Gon\u00e7alves", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Almgren", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Lagerstedt", "given": "J O", "initials": "JO"}, {"family": "Orho-Melander", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Engstr\u00f6m", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-09-21", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "0954-6820", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "J Intern Med"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1111/joim.12675", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Clinical Biomarkers": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c6761f62f1d9488ca64f266cef67224a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c6761f62f1d9488ca64f266cef67224a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d23e11e266a14e9d9e84db92232867a5", "title": "Major transcriptional changes observed in the Fulani, an ethnic group less susceptible to malaria.", "authors": [{"family": "Quin", "given": "Jaclyn E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Bujila", "given": "Ioana", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ch\u00e9rif", "given": "Mariama", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sanou", "given": "Guillaume S", "initials": "GS"}, {"family": "Qu", "given": "Ying", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Vafa Homann", "given": "Manijeh", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rolicka", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sirima", "given": "Sodiomon B", "initials": "SB"}, {"family": "O'Connell", "given": "Mary A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Lennartsson", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Troye-Blomberg", "given": "Marita", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nebie", "given": "Issa", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "\u00d6stlund Farrants", "given": "Ann-Kristin", "initials": "AK"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-09-19", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2050-084X", "issue": null, "title": "Elife"}, "abstract": "The Fulani ethnic group has relatively better protection from Plasmodium falciparum malaria, as reflected by fewer symptomatic cases of malaria, lower infection rates, and lower parasite densities compared to sympatric ethnic groups.

Previously, based on the material and historical records, the male sex has been associated with the gender of the warrior and such was the case with Bj 581. An earlier osteological classification of the individual as female was considered controversial in a historical and archaeological context. A genomic confirmation of the biological sex of the individual was considered necessary to solve the issue.\n\nGenome-wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the biological sex, to support skeletal integrity, and to investigate the genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals as well as modern-day groups. Additionally, a strontium isotope analysis was conducted to highlight the mobility of the individual.\n\nThe genomic results revealed the lack of a Y-chromosome and thus a female biological sex, and the mtDNA analyses support a single-individual origin of sampled elements.

This heptapeptide often opposes the effects of the mother peptide. Hence, SP1-7 is having anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects in experimental models. Despite all encouraging properties of SP1-7 its exact mode of action has not yet been elucidated which has hampered further development of this heptapeptide in drug discovery. Contrary to SP that mediates its biological activity via the NK-1 receptor, the N-terminal fragment SP1-7 acts through an unknown target that is distinct from all known opioid and tachykinin receptors. The SP1-7 amide 1 (Arg(1)-Pro(2)-Lys(3)-Pro(4)-Gln(5)-Gln(6)-Phe(7)-NH2) was previously shown to be superior to the endogenous SP1-7 in all experimental pain models where the two compounds were compared. Herein, we report that N-methylation scan of the backbone of the SP1-7 amide (1) results in peptides that are significantly less prone to undergo proteolysis in plasma from both mouse and human. However, with the two exceptions of the [MeLys(3)]SP1-7 amide (3) and the [MeGln(5)]SP1-7 amide (4), the peptides with a methyl group attached to the backbone are devoid of significant anti-allodynic effects after peripheral administration in the spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model of neuropathic pain. It is suggested that the N-methylation does not allow these peptides to form the accurate bioactive conformations or interactions required for efficient binding to the macromolecular target. The importance of intact N-terminal Arg(1) and C-terminal Phe(7), anticipated to serve as address and message residues, respectively, for achieving the anti-allodynic effect is emphasized. Notably, the three heptapeptides: the SP1-7 amide (1), the [MeLys(3)]SP1-7 amide (3) amide and the [MeGln(5)]SP1-7 amide (4) are all considerably more effective in the SNI mouse model than gabapentin that is widely used in the clinic for treatment of neuropathic pain.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejps.2017.09.007", "pmid": "28887235", "labels": {"Drug Discovery and Development (DDD)": "Service", "Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0928-0987(17)30497-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fb6cd985b2214826bf1603929fdb4a76.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fb6cd985b2214826bf1603929fdb4a76"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4a316c8916a44647a751f72482d76147", "title": "Analysing Microbial Community Composition through Amplicon Sequencing: From Sampling to Hypothesis Testing.", "authors": [{"family": "Hugerth", "given": "Luisa W", "initials": "LW"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-09-04", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1664-302X", "issue": null, "pages": "1561", "title": "Front Microbiol"}, "abstract": "Microbial ecology as a scientific field is fundamentally driven by technological advance.

We sequenced fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) amplicons to assess EMF communities in 10- to 60-year-old Scots pine stands regenerated either using seed trees or through replanting of clear-cuts with old natural stands as reference. We also investigated local EMF communities around retained old trees. We found that retention of seed trees failed to mitigate the impact of harvesting on EMF community composition and diversity. With increasing stand age, EMF communities became increasingly similar to those in old natural stands and permanently retained trees maintained EMF locally. From our observations, we conclude that EMF communities, at least common species, post-harvest are more influenced by environmental filtering, resulting from environmental changes induced by harvest, than by the continuity of trees.

They represent a sister group to all other vascular plants, from which they differ in that their leaves are microphylls-that is, leaves with a single, unbranched vein, emerging from the protostele without a leaf gap-not megaphylls. All leaves represent determinate organs originating on the flanks of indeterminate SAMs. Thus, leaf formation requires the suppression of indeterminacy, that is, of KNOX transcription factors. In seed plants, this is mediated by different groups of transcription factors including ARP and YABBY.We generated a shoot tip transcriptome of Huperzia selago (Lycopodiales) to examine the genes involved in leaf formation. Our H. selago transcriptome does not contain any ARP homolog, although transcriptomes of Selaginella spp. do. Surprisingly, we discovered a YABBY homolog, although these transcription factors were assumed to have evolved only in seed plants.The existence of a YABBY homolog in H. selago suggests that YABBY evolved already in the common ancestor of the vascular plants, and subsequently was lost in some lineages like Selaginellales, whereas ARP may have been lost in Lycopodiales. The presence of YABBY in the common ancestor of vascular plants would also support the hypothesis that this common ancestor had a simplex SAM. Furthermore, a comparison of the expression patterns of ARP in shoot tips of Selaginella kraussiana (Harrison CJ, etal. 2005. Independent recruitment of a conserved developmental mechanism during leaf evolution. Nature 434(7032):509-514.) and YABBY in shoot tips of H. selago implies that the development of microphylls, unlike megaphylls, does not seem to depend on the combined activities of ARP and YABBY.

Although mutations in ATRX or DAXX have been reported in a significant proportion of pancreatic NETs, the mutational status of ATRX and DAXX and their possible pathogenetic role in pituitary NETs are unknown. Facing a difficult diagnostic case of an invasive serotonin and adrenocorticotroph hormone immunoreactive NET in the sellar region, we explored the immunohistochemical expression of serotonin, ATRX, and DAXX in a large series of pituitary endocrine tumors of different types from 246 patients and in 2 corticotroph carcinomas. None of the pituitary tumors expressed serotonin, suggesting that serotonin immunoreactive sellar tumors represent primary or secondary NETs of nonpituitary origin. Normal expression of ATRX and DAXX in pituitary tumors suggests that ATRX and DAXX do not play a role in the pathogenesis of pituitary endocrine tumors that remain localized to the sellar and perisellar region. A lack of ATRX or DAXX in a sellar NET suggests a nonpituitary NET, probably of pancreatic origin. One of the 2 examined corticotroph carcinomas, however, demonstrated negative ATRX immunolabeling due to an ATRX gene mutation.

To unravel BRAFi resistance mechanisms we have performed gene expression and mass spectrometry based proteome profiling of the sensitive parental A375 BRAF V600E-mutated human melanoma cell line and of daughter cell lines with induced BRAFi resistance. Increased expression of two novel resistance candidates, aminopeptidase-N (CD13/ANPEP) and ETS transcription factor FLI1 was observed in the BRAFi-resistant daughter cell lines. In addition, increased levels of the previously reported resistance mediators, receptor tyrosine kinase ephrine receptor A2 (EPHA2) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET were also identified. The expression of these proteins was assessed in matched tumor samples from melanoma patients obtained before BRAFi and after disease progression. MET was overexpressed in all progression samples while the expression of the other candidates varied between the individual patients. Targeting CD13/ANPEP by a blocking antibody induced apoptosis in both parental A375- and BRAFi-resistant daughter cells as well as in melanoma cells with intrinsic BRAFi resistance and led to dephosphorylation of EPHA2 on S897, previously demonstrated to cause inhibition of the migratory capacity. AKT and RSK, both reported to induce EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation, were also dephosphorylated after inhibition of CD13/ANPEP. FLI1 silencing also caused decreases in EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and in total MET protein expression. In addition, silencing of FLI1 sensitized the resistant cells to BRAFi. Furthermore, we show that BRAFi in combination with the multi kinase inhibitor dasatinib can abrogate BRAFi resistance and decrease both EPHA2 S897 phosphorylation and total FLI1 protein expression.

Here, we systematically explored common variants of genes representing molecular targets of coxibs for association with CAD. Given a broad spectrum of pleiotropic effects of coxibs, our intention was to narrow potential mechanisms affecting CAD risk as we hypothesized that the affected genes may also display genomic signals of coronary disease risk. A Drug Gene Interaction Database search identified 47 gene products to be affected by coxibs. We traced association signals in 200-kb regions surrounding these genes in 84,813 CAD cases and 202,543 controls. Based on a threshold of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5) (Bonferroni correction for 3131 haplotype blocks), four gene loci yielded significant associations. The lead SNPs were rs7270354 (MMP9), rs4888383 (BCAR1), rs6905288 (VEGFA1), and rs556321 (CACNA1E).

The heptapeptide 1 frequently exhibits opposite effects to those induced by SP, such as exerting antinociception, or attenuating thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The heptapeptide SP1-7 amide (2, Arg(1)-Pro(2)-Lys(3)-Pro(4)-Gln(5)-Gln(6)-Phe(7)-NH2) is often more efficacious than 1 in experimental pain models. We have now assessed the anti-allodynic outcome after systemic administration of 2 and a series of Ala-substituted and truncated analogues of 2, in the spared nerve injury (SNI) mice model and the results obtained were correlated with in vitro plasma stability and permeability measurements. It is herein demonstrated that an intact Arg(1) in SP1-7 amide analogues is fundamental for retaining a potent in vivo effect, while Lys(3) of 2 is less important. A displacement with Ala(1) or truncation rendered the peptide analogues either inactive or with a significantly attenuated in vivo activity. Thus, the pentapeptide SP3-7 amide (7, t1/2=11.1 min) proven to be the major metabolite of 2, demonstrated an in vivo effect itself although considerably less significant than 2 in the SNI model. Intraperitoneal administration of 2 in a low dose furnished the most powerful anti-allodynic effect in the SNI model of all the analogous evaluated, despite a fast proteolysis of 2 in plasma (t1/2=6.4 min). It is concluded that not only the C-terminal residue, that we previously demonstrated, but also the N-terminal with its basic side chain, are important for achieving effective pain relief.

Both particles were taken up by cells and nanoceria, but not Sm-doped nanoceria, elicited a temporary cytoprotective effect upon exposure to DMNQ. Next, we employed RNA sequencing to explore the transcriptional responses induced by nanoceria or Sm-doped nanoceria during neuronal differentiation. Detailed computational analyses showed that nanoceria altered pathways and networks relevant for neuronal development, leading us to hypothesize that nanoceria inhibits neuronal differentiation, and that nanoceria and Sm-doped nanoceria both interfere with cytoskeletal organization. We confirmed that nanoceria reduced neuron specific \u03b23-tubulin expression, a marker of neuronal differentiation, and GFAP, a neuroglial marker. Furthermore, using super-resolution microscopy approaches, we could show that both particles interfered with cytoskeletal organization and altered the structure of neural growth cones.

Its mission is to provide high-quality human heart tissue for research into the molecular basis of human heart failure by working collaboratively with experts in this field. We argue that, by comparing tissues from failing human hearts with age-matched non-failing healthy donor hearts, the results will be more relevant than research using animal models, particularly if their physiology is very different from humans. Tissue from heart surgery must generally be used soon after collection or it significantly deteriorates. Freezing is an option but it raises concerns that freezing causes substantial damage at the cellular and molecular level. The SHB contains failing samples from heart transplant patients and others who provided informed consent for the use of their tissue for research. All samples are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen within 40\u00a0min of their removal from the patient, and in less than 5-10\u00a0min in the case of coronary arteries and left ventricle samples. To date, the SHB has collected tissue from about 450 failing hearts (>15,000 samples) from patients with a wide range of etiologies as well as increasing numbers of cardiomyectomy samples from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The Bank also has hearts from over 120 healthy organ donors whose hearts, for a variety of reasons (mainly tissue-type incompatibility with waiting heart transplant recipients), could not be used for transplantation. Donor hearts were collected by the St Vincent's Hospital Heart and Lung transplantation team from local hospitals or within a 4-h jet flight from Sydney. They were flushed with chilled cardioplegic solution and transported to Sydney where they were quickly cryopreserved in small samples. Failing and/or donor samples have been used by more than 60 research teams around the world, and have resulted in more than 100 research papers. The tissues most commonly requested are from donor left ventricles, but right ventricles, atria, interventricular system, and coronary arteries vessels have also been reported. All tissues are stored for long-term use in liquid N or vapor (170-180\u00a0\u00b0C), and are shipped under nitrogen vapor to avoid degradation of sensitive molecules such as RNAs and giant proteins.

One proposed remediation strategy for coastal dead zones in the Baltic Sea is to mix the water column using pump stations, circulating oxygenated water to the sea bottom. Although microbial metabolism in the sediment surface is recognized as key in regulating bulk chemical fluxes, it remains unknown how the microbial community and its metabolic processes are influenced by shifts in oxygen availability. Here, coastal Baltic Sea sediments sampled from oxic and anoxic sites, plus an intermediate area subjected to episodic oxygenation, were experimentally exposed to oxygen shifts. Chemical, 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate changes in chemistry fluxes, microbial community structure, and metabolic functions in the sediment surface.\n\nCompared to anoxic controls, oxygenation of anoxic sediment resulted in a proliferation of bacterial populations in the facultative anaerobic genus Sulfurovum that are capable of oxidizing toxic sulfide. Furthermore, the oxygenated sediment had higher amounts of RNA transcripts annotated as sqr, fccB, and dsrA involved in sulfide oxidation. In addition, the importance of cryptic sulfur cycling was highlighted by the oxidative genes listed above as well as dsvA, ttrB, dmsA, and ddhAB that encode reductive processes being identified in anoxic and intermediate sediments turned oxic. In particular, the intermediate site sediments responded differently upon oxygenation compared to the anoxic and oxic site sediments. This included a microbial community composition with more habitat generalists, lower amounts of RNA transcripts attributed to methane oxidation, and a reduced rate of organic matter degradation.\n\nThese novel data emphasize that genetic expression analyses has the power to identify key molecular mechanisms that regulate microbial community responses upon oxygenation of dead zones. Moreover, these results highlight that microbial responses, and therefore ultimately remediation efforts, depend largely on the oxygenation history of sites. Furthermore, it was shown that re-oxygenation efforts to remediate dead zones could ultimately be facilitated by in situ microbial molecular mechanisms involved in removal of toxic H2S and the potent greenhouse gas methane.", "doi": "10.1186/s40168-017-0311-5", "pmid": "28793929", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s40168-017-0311-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5549381"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b85241f44e074517a87e335217e446e7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b85241f44e074517a87e335217e446e7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b95838961321464bbddc6e42c65bc466", "title": "Rho-associated kinase is a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.", "authors": [{"family": "Dyberg", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fransson", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Andonova", "given": "Teodora", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sveinbj\u00f6rnsson", "given": "Baldur", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "L\u00e4nnerholm-Palm", "given": "Jessika", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Olsen", "given": "Thale K", "initials": "TK"}, {"family": "Forsberg", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Herlenius", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Martinsson", "given": "Tommy", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Brodin", "given": "Bertha", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Kogner", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Johnsen", "given": "John Inge", "initials": "JI"}, {"family": "Wickstr\u00f6m", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-08-08", "journal": {"volume": "114", "issn": "1091-6490", "issue": "32", "pages": "E6603-E6612", "title": "Proc.

We carried out thorough clinical, radiological, and bone tissue analyses to explore the consequences of these deletions and to further elucidate the role of PLS3 in bone homeostasis. In family 1, the 2 affected brothers had a deletion of exons 4-16 (NM_005032) in PLS3, inherited from their healthy mother.

The 3 patients presented in early childhood with severe spinal compression fractures involving all vertebral bodies. The 2 brothers in family 1 also displayed subtle dysmorphic facial features and both had developed a myopathic gait. Extensive analyses of a transiliac bone biopsy from 1 patient showed a prominent increase in osteoid volume, osteoid thickness, and in mineralizing lag time. Results from quantitative backscattered electron imaging and Raman microspectroscopy showed a significant hypomineralization of the bone.

We aimed to identify germline mutations involved in the carcinogenesis of SI-NETs. The strategy included next-generation sequencing of exome- and/or whole-genome of blood DNA, and in selected cases, tumor DNA, from 24 patients from 15 families with the history of SI-NETs. We identified seven candidate mutations in six genes that were further studied using 215 sporadic SI-NET patients. The result was compared with the frequency of the candidate mutations in three control cohorts with a total of 35,688 subjects. A heterozygous variant causing an amino acid substitution p.(Gly396Asp) in the MutY DNA glycosylase gene (MUTYH) was significantly enriched in SI-NET patients (minor allele frequencies 0.013 and 0.003 for patients and controls respectively) and resulted in odds ratio of 5.09 (95% confidence interval 1.56-14.74; P value\u2009=\u20090.0038). We also found a statistically significant difference in age at diagnosis between familial and sporadic SI-NETs. MUTYH is involved in the protection of DNA from mutations caused by oxidative stress. The inactivation of this gene leads to specific increase of G:C-\u2009>\u2009T:A transversions in DNA sequence and has been shown to cause various cancers in humans and experimental animals. Our results suggest that p.(Gly396Asp) in MUTYH, and potentially other mutations in additional members of the same DNA excision-repair pathway (such as the OGG1 gene) might be involved in driving the tumorigenesis leading to familial and sporadic SI-NETs.", "doi": "10.1530/ERC-17-0196", "pmid": "28634180", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ERC-17-0196"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5527373"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/00efcc10c8fe4acdb9bdc477e661536f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/00efcc10c8fe4acdb9bdc477e661536f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "18e29d752735475b84a271e4be906d40", "title": "Combination of phage and Gram-positive bacterial display of human antibody repertoires enables isolation of functional high affinity binders", "authors": [{"family": "Hu", "given": "Francis Jingxin", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Volk", "given": "Anna Luisa", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "S\u00e4ll", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Borrebaeck", "given": "Carl", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rockberg", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-08-00", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "1871-6784", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "New Biotechnology"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.nbt.2017.07.011", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Drug Discovery and Development (DDD)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/18e29d752735475b84a271e4be906d40.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/18e29d752735475b84a271e4be906d40"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "371f92da9ec140d28854d341b99ef5e9", "title": "Regional genetic differentiation in the blue mussel from the Baltic Sea area", "authors": [{"family": "Larsson", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lind", "given": "E E", "initials": "EE"}, {"family": "Corell", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Grahn", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smolarz", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "L\u00f6nn", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "195", "issn": "0272-7714", "issue": null, "pages": "98-109", "title": "Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecss.2016.06.016", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/371f92da9ec140d28854d341b99ef5e9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/371f92da9ec140d28854d341b99ef5e9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3976107b7f9a4fee91d089e1cbdc071e", "title": "Rates of gene flow in a freshwater snail and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity", "authors": [{"family": "Hollander", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ahlgren", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Br\u00f6nmark", "given": "Christer", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "121", "issn": "0024-4066", "issue": "4", "pages": "764-770", "title": ""}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/biolinnean/blx028", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3976107b7f9a4fee91d089e1cbdc071e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3976107b7f9a4fee91d089e1cbdc071e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "482e4ddecdcd4d2aaae1ac0d32206932", "title": "Investigation of calcium-dependent activity and conformational dynamics of zebra fish 12-lipoxygenase", "authors": [{"family": "Mittal", "given": "Monica", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hasan", "given": "Mahmudul", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Balagunaseelan", "given": "Navisraj", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Fauland", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wheelock", "given": "Craig", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "R\u00e5dmark", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Haeggstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jesper Z", "initials": "JZ"}, {"family": "Rinaldo-Matthis", "given": "Agnes", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "1861", "issn": "0304-4165", "issue": "8", "pages": "2099-2111", "title": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) -

The region is also the gate-way out of Africa, as well as a portal for migration into Africa from Eurasia via the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. We investigate the population history of northeast Africa by genotyping ~3.9 million SNPs in 221 individuals from 18 populations sampled in Sudan and South Sudan and combine this data with published genome-wide data from surrounding areas. We find a strong genetic divide between the populations from the northeastern parts of the region (Nubians, central Arab populations, and the Beja) and populations towards the west and south (Nilotes, Darfur and Kordofan populations). This differentiation is mainly caused by a large Eurasian ancestry component of the northeast populations likely driven by migration of Middle Eastern groups followed by admixture that affected the local populations in a north-to-south succession of events. Genetic evidence points to an early admixture event in the Nubians, concurrent with historical contact between North Sudanese and Arab groups. We estimate the admixture in current-day Sudanese Arab populations to about 700 years ago, coinciding with the fall of Dongola in 1315/1316 AD, a wave of admixture that reached the Darfurian/Kordofanian populations some 400-200 years ago.

Waters from cyanidation plants for gold extraction will often conjointly include toxic, sulfur containing thiocyanate. More stringent regulatory limits on the release of mining wastes containing compounds such as inorganic sulfur compounds, nitrate, and thiocyanate, along the need to increase production from sulfide mineral mining calls for low cost techniques to remove these pollutants under ambient temperatures (approximately 8\u00a0\u00b0C).

A short, nucleosome size human-specific promoter CpG island (CGI), a core of this region may serve as a regulatory module, which is hypomethylated in neurons, enriched in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and targeted by USF2, a methylation-sensitive E-box transcription factor (TF). USF2 activates PDYN transcription in model systems, and binds to nonmethylated CGI in dlPFC. USF2 and PDYN expression is correlated, and USF2 and PDYN proteins are co-localized in dlPFC.

The notion of haplotype-resolved sequencing data has recently gained traction to reduce this unwanted ambiguity and enable exploration of other forms of genetic variation; beyond studies of just nucleotide polymorphisms, such as compound heterozygosity and structural variations. Here we describe Droplet Barcode Sequencing, a novel approach for creating linked-read sequencing libraries by uniquely barcoding the information within single DNA molecules in emulsion droplets, without the aid of specialty reagents or microfluidic devices. Barcode generation and template amplification is performed simultaneously in a single enzymatic reaction, greatly simplifying the workflow and minimizing assay costs compared to alternative approaches. The method has been applied to phase multiple loci targeting all exons of the highly variable Human Leukocyte Antigen A (HLA-A) gene, with DNA from eight individuals present in the same assay. Barcode-based clustering of sequencing reads confirmed analysis of over 2000 independently assayed template molecules, with an average of 753 reads in support of called polymorphisms. Our results show unequivocal characterization of all alleles present, validated by correspondence against confirmed HLA database entries and haplotyping results from previous studies.", "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkx436", "pmid": "28525570", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "3835310"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5569991"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4bce9e4e56a24b87b1fc941557a2ade8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4bce9e4e56a24b87b1fc941557a2ade8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9a4725f904ef40cc9b59e855208cec4d", "title": "Biophysical characterization of the calmodulin-like domain of Plasmodium falciparum calcium dependent protein kinase 3", "authors": [{"family": "Andresen", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Niklasson", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Cassman Ekl\u00f6f", "given": "Sofie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wallner", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-07-26", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "7", "pages": "e0181721", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0181721", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Service", "Protein Science Facility (PSF)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9a4725f904ef40cc9b59e855208cec4d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9a4725f904ef40cc9b59e855208cec4d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fd87172e6f1e446c876e6805eeb45307", "title": "PLS3 sequencing in childhood-onset primary osteoporosis identifies two novel disease-causing variants.", "authors": [{"family": "K\u00e4mpe", "given": "A J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Costantini", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "M\u00e4kitie", "given": "R E", "initials": "RE"}, {"family": "J\u00e4ntti", "given": "N", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Valta", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "M\u00e4yr\u00e4np\u00e4\u00e4", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kr\u00f6ger", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Pekkinen", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Taylan", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Jiao", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "M\u00e4kitie", "given": "O", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-07-26", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "1433-2965", "issue": null, "title": "Osteoporos Int"}, "abstract": "Altogether 95 children with primary bone fragility were screened for variants in PLS3, the gene underlying X-linked osteoporosis.

The aim of our study was to perform an unbiased search for autoantibodies in patients with a first psychotic episode, and to explore the association between any seroreactivity and the development of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) disorder characterized by chronic or relapsing psychotic symptoms. We collected plasma samples from 53 patients when they were treated for their first-episode psychosis, and 41 non-psychotic controls, after which the patients were followed for a mean duration of 7 years. Thirty patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or a long-term unspecified nonorganic psychosis during follow-up, whereas 23 patients achieved complete remission. At the end of follow-up, plasma samples were analyzed for IgG reactivity to 2304 fragments of human proteins using a multiplexed affinity proteomic technique. Eight patient samples showed autoreactivity to the N-terminal fragment of the PAGE (P antigen) protein family (PAGE2B/PAGE2/PAGE5), whereas no such autoreactivity was seen among the controls.

The occurrence of selection during the haploid phase can have far-reaching consequences for fundamental evolutionary processes including the rate of adaptation, the extent of inbreeding depression, and the load of deleterious mutations, as well as for applied research into fertilization technology. Although haploid selection is well established in plants, current dogma assumes that in animals, intact fertile sperm within a single ejaculate are equivalent at siring viable offspring. Using the zebrafish Danio rerio, we show that selection on phenotypic variation among intact fertile sperm within an ejaculate affects offspring fitness. Longer-lived sperm sired embryos with increased survival and a reduced number of apoptotic cells, and adult male offspring exhibited higher fitness. The effect on embryo viability was carried over into the second generation without further selection and was equally strong in both sexes.

The euryhaline bay barnacle Balanus improvisus (Darwin, 1854) (= Amphibalanus improvisus) can tolerate a wide range of salinities, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the osmoregulatory capacity of this truly brackish species are not well understood. Aquaporins are pore-forming integral membrane proteins that facilitate transport of water, small solutes and ions through cellular membranes, and that have been shown to be important for osmoregulation in many organisms. The knowledge of the function of aquaporins in crustaceans is, however, limited and nothing is known about them in barnacles. We here present the repertoire of aquaporins from a thecostracan crustacean, the barnacle B. improvisus, based on genome and transcriptome sequencing. Our analyses reveal that B. improvisus contains eight genes for aquaporins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they represented members of the classical water aquaporins (Aqp1, Aqp2), the aquaglyceroporins (Glp1, Glp2), the unorthodox aquaporin (Aqp12) and the arthropod-specific big brain aquaporin (Bib). Interestingly, we also found two big brain-like proteins (BibL1 and BibL2) constituting a new group of aquaporins not yet described in arthropods. In addition, we found that the two water-specific aquaporins were expressed as C-terminal splice variants. Heterologous expression of some of the aquaporins followed by functional characterization showed that Aqp1 transported water and Glp2 water and glycerol, agreeing with the predictions of substrate specificity based on 3D modeling and phylogeny. To investigate a possible role for the B. improvisus aquaporins in osmoregulation, mRNA expression changes in adult barnacles were analysed after long-term acclimation to different salinities. The most pronounced expression difference was seen for AQP1 with a substantial (>100-fold) decrease in the mantle tissue in low salinity (3 PSU) compared to high salinity (33 PSU).

DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.213", "pmid": "28284638", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0048-9697(17)30230-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/358a7e145b1147069d52e3cd9b925630.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/358a7e145b1147069d52e3cd9b925630"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3b1e943157da4156b2c0640f2a2c3e1a", "title": "Prediction and modeling of pre-analytical sampling errors as a strategy to improve plasma NMR metabolomics data", "authors": [{"family": "Brunius", "given": "Carl", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Malmodin", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "B G\u00f6ran", "initials": "BG"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Tybring", "given": "Gunnel", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Landberg", "given": "Rikard", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-07-14", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "1367-4811", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "Bioinformatics"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btx442", "pmid": "29036400", "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3b1e943157da4156b2c0640f2a2c3e1a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3b1e943157da4156b2c0640f2a2c3e1a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ae326cc43f784533bbcec9e0dfdf1173", "title": "A TRPV1-to-secretagogin regulatory axis controls pancreatic \u03b2-cell survival by modulating protein turnover.", "authors": [{"family": "Malenczyk", "given": "Katarzyna", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Girach", "given": "Fatima", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Szodorai", "given": "Edit", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Storm", "given": "Petter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Segerstolpe", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Tortoriello", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Schnell", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Mulder", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Romanov", "given": "Roman A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Bor\u00f3k", "given": "Erzs\u00e9bet", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Piscitelli", "given": "Fabiana", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Di Marzo", "given": "Vincenzo", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Szab\u00f3", "given": "G\u00e1bor", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Rickard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kubicek", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lubec", "given": "Gert", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "H\u00f6kfelt", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wagner", "given": "Ludwig", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Groop", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Harkany", "given": "Tibor", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-07-14", "journal": {"volume": "36", "issn": "1460-2075", "issue": "14", "pages": "2107-2125", "title": "EMBO J."}, "abstract": "Ca(2+)-sensor proteins are generally implicated in insulin release through SNARE interactions.

The use of noninvasively collected samples or museum-preserved specimens reduces the pressure on modern populations by removing the need to capture and handle live animals. However, endogenous DNA content in such samples is low, making shotgun sequencing a financially prohibitive approach. Here, we apply a target enrichment method to retrieve mitochondrial genomes from 65 museum specimens and 56 noninvasively collected faecal samples of two endangered great ape species, Grauer's gorilla and the eastern chimpanzee. We show that the applied method is suitable for a wide range of sample types that differ in endogenous DNA content, increasing the proportion of target reads to over 300-fold. By systematically evaluating biases introduced during target enrichment of pooled museum samples, we show that capture is less efficient for fragments shorter or longer than the baits, that the proportion of human contaminating reads increases postcapture although capture efficiency is lower for human compared to gorilla fragments with a gorilla-generated bait, and that the rate of jumping PCR is considerable, but can be controlled for with a double-barcoding approach. We succeed in capturing complete mitochondrial genomes from faecal samples, but observe reduced capture efficiency as sequence divergence increases between the bait and target species. As previously shown for museum specimens, we demonstrate here that mitochondrial genome capture from field-collected faecal samples is a robust and reliable approach for population-wide studies of nonmodel organisms.", "doi": "10.1111/1755-0998.12699", "pmid": "28675688", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3696fbf5832447b98e3ff70736927e22.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3696fbf5832447b98e3ff70736927e22"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1fe52c77fec94407939714b233d44d7b", "title": "Mineral Type Structures Soil Microbial Communities", "authors": [{"family": "Ahmed", "given": "Engy", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hugerth", "given": "Luisa W", "initials": "LW"}, {"family": "Logue", "given": "J\u00fcrg B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Br\u00fcchert", "given": "Volker", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Holmstr\u00f6m", "given": "Sara J M", "initials": "SJM"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-07-03", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "0149-0451", "issue": null, "pages": "1-8", "title": "Geomicrobiology Journal"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/01490451.2016.1225868", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1fe52c77fec94407939714b233d44d7b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1fe52c77fec94407939714b233d44d7b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f4dc3cf02d2449a18177221e5fc4126e", "title": "Paternal personality and social status influence offspring activity in zebrafish.", "authors": [{"family": "Zajitschek", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Herbert-Read", "given": "James E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Abbasi", "given": "Nasir M", "initials": "NM"}, {"family": "Zajitschek", "given": "Felix", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Immler", "given": "Simone", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-07-03", "journal": {"volume": "17", "issn": "1471-2148", "issue": "1", "pages": "157", "title": "BMC Evol.

While the impact of chemical and physical factors such as toxins or diet on the fitness of the parents and their offspring have been studied extensively, the importance of behavioural and social circumstances has only recently been recognised. Behavioural traits such as personality characteristics can be relatively stable, and partly comprise a genetic component but we know little about the non-genetic transmission of plastic behavioural traits from parents to offspring. We investigated the relative effect of personality and of social dominance as indicators at the opposite ends of the plasticity range on offspring behaviour in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). We assessed male boldness, a behavioural trait that has previously been shown previously to possess genetic underpinnings, and experimentally manipulated male social status to assess the association between the two types of behaviour and their correlation with offspring activity.\n\nWe found a clear interaction between the relatively stable and putative genetic effects based on inherited differences in personality and the experimentally induced epigenetic effects from changes in the social status of the father on offspring activity.\n\nOur study shows that offspring behaviour is determined by a combination of paternal personality traits and on-genetic effects derived from the social status of the father.", "doi": "10.1186/s12862-017-1005-0", "pmid": "28673261", "labels": {"Genome Engineering Zebrafish": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s12862-017-1005-0"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5496241"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f4dc3cf02d2449a18177221e5fc4126e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f4dc3cf02d2449a18177221e5fc4126e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e81cd30a07184c74adb303274bd88923", "title": "Interspecific Plastome Recombination Reflects Ancient Reticulate Evolution in Picea (Pinaceae).", "authors": [{"family": "Sullivan", "given": "Alexis R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Schiffthaler", "given": "Bastian", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Thompson", "given": "Stacey Lee", "initials": "SL"}, {"family": "Street", "given": "Nathaniel R", "initials": "NR"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Xiao-Ru", "initials": "XR"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-07-01", "journal": {"volume": "34", "issn": "1537-1719", "issue": "7", "pages": "1689-1701", "title": "Mol.

While exceptions to these assumptions can profoundly influence evolutionary inference, detecting them can require extensive sampling, abundant sequence data, and detailed testing. Using advancements in high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the whole plastomes of 65 accessions of Picea, a genus of \u223c35 coniferous forest tree species, to test for deviations from canonical plastome evolution. Using complementary hypothesis and data-driven tests, we found evidence for chimeric plastomes generated by interspecific hybridization and recombination in the clade comprising Norway spruce (P. abies) and 10 other species. Support for interspecific recombination remained after controlling for sequence saturation, positive selection, and potential alignment artifacts. These results reconcile previous conflicting plastid-based phylogenies and strengthen the mounting evidence of reticulate evolution in Picea. Given the relatively high frequency of hybridization and biparental plastid inheritance in plants, we suggest interspecific plastome recombination may be more widespread than currently appreciated and could underlie reported cases of discordant plastid phylogenies.", "doi": "10.1093/molbev/msx111", "pmid": "28383641", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics

We identified a novel association between the coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) in AKT2 and fasting plasma insulin (FI), a gene in which rare fully penetrant mutations are causal for monogenic glycemic disorders. The low-frequency allele is associated with a 12% increase in FI levels. This variant is present at 1.1% frequency in Finns but virtually absent in individuals from other ancestries. Carriers of the FI-increasing allele had increased 2-h insulin values, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.05).

Preliminary population genomic analyses (global AMOVA and Bayesian clustering) were implemented. Our results showed that the 2b-RAD genotyping protocol is effective for R. ecuadoriensis and likely for other triatomine species. However, only BcgI and CspCI restriction enzymes provided a number of markers suitable for population genomic analysis at the read depth we generated. Our preliminary genomic analyses detected a signal of genetic structuring across the study area.\n\nOur findings suggest that 2b-RAD genotyping is both a cost effective and methodologically simple approach for generating high resolution genomic data for Chagas disease vectors with the power to distinguish between different vector populations at epidemiologically relevant scales.

Proper assignment of sequences to germline genes are important for many such processes, for instance in the analysis of somatic hypermutation. Germline gene inference from antibody-encoding transcriptomes, by using tools such as TIgGER or IgDiscover, has a potential to enhance the quality of such analyses. These tools may also be used to identify germline genes not previously known. In this study, we exploited such software for germline gene inference and define aspects of analysis settings and pre-existing knowledge of germline genes that affect the outcome of gene inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capacity of IGHJ and IGHD haplotype inference, whenever subjects are heterozygous with respect to such genes, to lend support to IGHV gene inference in general, and to the identification of novel alleles presently not recognized by germline gene reference directories. We propose that such haplotype analysis shall, whenever possible, be used in future best practice to support the outcome of germline gene inference. IGHJ-directed haplotype inference was also used to identify haplotypes not expressing some IGHV germline genes. In particular, we identified a haplotype that did not express several major germline genes such as IGHV1-8, IGHV3-9, IGHV3-15, IGHV1-18, IGHV3-21, and IGHV3-23.

A SNP array was used in segregation analysis.\n\nCopy number analysis of the WGS data revealed a heterozygous deletion of ~578\u00a0kb on chromosome 8. The deletion removes the 5' UTR region, the noncoding exon 1 and the putative promoter region of SLC20A2 as well as the coding regions of six other genes.\n\nOur results support haploinsufficiency of SLC20A2 as a pathogenetic mechanism in PFBC. Analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) is emerging as a crucial step in the molecular genetic diagnostics of PFBC, and it should not be limited to coding regions, as causative variants may reside in the noncoding parts of known disease-associated genes.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12697", "pmid": "27726124", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fed9a0e44bda4fa89406ae38f21e2413.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fed9a0e44bda4fa89406ae38f21e2413"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "64f09ccd0fe64bf093e9d17de685ef9c", "title": "Moderate nucleotide diversity in the Atlantic herring is associated with a low mutation rate", "authors": [{"family": "Feng", "given": "Chungang", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lamichhaney", "given": "Sangeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rubin", "given": "Carl Johan", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Rafati", "given": "Nima", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Casini", "given": "Michele", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Folkvord", "given": "Arild", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-06-30", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2050-084X", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "Elife"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.7554/elife.23907", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/64f09ccd0fe64bf093e9d17de685ef9c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/64f09ccd0fe64bf093e9d17de685ef9c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7c8cc7a768524b84be600507b658f4b9", "title": "The wolf reference genome sequence (Canis lupus lupus) and its implications for Canis spp. population genomics.", "authors": [{"family": "Gopalakrishnan", "given": "Shyam", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Samaniego Castruita", "given": "Jose A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Sinding", "given": "Mikkel-Holger S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Kuderna", "given": "Lukas F K", "initials": "LFK"}, {"family": "R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen", "given": "Jannikke", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Petersen", "given": "Bent", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Sicheritz-Ponten", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Larson", "given": "Greger", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Orlando", "given": "Ludovic", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Marques-Bonet", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Hansen", "given": "Anders J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Dal\u00e9n", "given": "Love", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gilbert", "given": "M Thomas P", "initials": "MTP"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-06-29", "journal": {"volume": "18", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": "1", "pages": "495", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "An increasing number of studies are addressing the evolutionary genomics of dog domestication, principally through resequencing dog, wolf and related canid genomes.

Using a multifactorial study, we elucidated the effects of both genetic and environmental factors on regulation of lipogenesis in Y.\u00a0lipolytica and identified how two opposite regulatory states both result in lipid accumulation. This study involved comparison of a strain overexpressing diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1) with a control strain grown under either nitrogen or carbon limitation conditions. A strong correlation was observed between the responses on the transcript and protein levels. Combination of DGA1 overexpression with nitrogen limitation resulted in a high level of lipid accumulation accompanied by downregulation of several amino acid biosynthetic pathways, including that of leucine in particular, and these changes were further correlated with a decrease in metabolic fluxes. This downregulation was supported by the measured decrease in the level of 2-isopropylmalate, an intermediate of leucine biosynthesis. Combining the multi-omics data with putative transcription factor binding motifs uncovered a contradictory role for TORC1 in controlling lipid accumulation, likely mediated through 2-isopropylmalate and a Leu3-like transcription factor.IMPORTANCE The ubiquitous metabolism of lipids involves refined regulation, and an enriched understanding of this regulation would have wide implications. Various factors can influence lipid metabolism, including the environment and genetics. We demonstrated, using a multi-omics and multifactorial experimental setup, that multiple factors affect lipid accumulation in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica Using integrative analysis, we identified novel interactions between nutrient restriction and genetic factors involving regulators that are highly conserved among eukaryotes.

Limited turnover stopped-flow kinetic measurements of the activated enzyme allowed us to more accurately determine the KD for the \"third\" low-affinity GSH binding site (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 mM). The rate of thiolate formation, k2 (0.77 \u00b1 0.06 s(-1)), relevant to turnover, could also be determined. By deriving the steady-state rate equation for a random sequential mechanism for MGST1, we can predict KM, kcat, and kcat/KM values from these and previously determined pre-steady-state rate constants (all determined at 5 \u00b0C). To assess whether the pre-steady-state behavior can account for the steady-state kinetic behavior, we have determined experimental values for kinetic parameters at 5 \u00b0C. For reactive substrates and the activated enzyme, data for the microscopic steps account for the global mechanism of MGST1. For the unactivated enzyme and more reactive electrophilic substrates, pre-steady-state and steady-state data can be reconciled only if a more active subpopulation of MGST1 is assumed. We suggest that unactivated MGST1 can be partially activated in its unmodified form.

Even though treatment of severe cGVHD has improved during recent years, it remains one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Biomarkers in blood that could aid in the diagnosis and classification of cGVHD severity are needed for the development of novel treatment strategies that can alleviate symptoms and reduce the need for painful and sometimes complicated tissue biopsies. Methods that comprehensively profile complex biological systems such as the immune system can reveal unanticipated markers when used with the appropriate methods of data analysis. Here, we used mass cytometry, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and multiplex assays to systematically profile immune cell populations in 68 patients with varying grades of cGVHD. We identified multiple subpopulations across T, B, and NK-cell lineages that distinguished patients with cGVHD from those without cGVHD and which were associated in varying ways with severity of cGVHD. Specifically, initial flow cytometry demonstrated that patients with more severe cGVHD had lower mucosal-associated T cell frequencies, with a concomitant higher level of CD38 expression on T cells. Mass cytometry could identify unique subpopulations specific for cGVHD severity albeit with some seemingly conflicting results. For instance, patients with severe cGVHD had an increased frequency of activated B cells compared to patients with moderate cGVHD while activated B cells were found at a reduced frequency in patients with mild cGVHD compared to patients without cGVHD. Moreover, results indicate it may be possible to validate mass cytometry results with clinically viable, smaller flow cytometry panels. Finally, no differences in levels of blood soluble markers could be identified, with the exception for the semi-soluble combined marker B-cell activating factor/B cell ratio, which was increased in patients with mild cGVHD compared to patients without cGVHD. These findings suggest that interdependencies between such perturbed subpopulations of cells play a role in cGVHD pathogenesis and can serve as future diagnostic and therapeutic targets.", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2017.00717", "pmid": "28674539", "labels": {"Mass Cytometry": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5474470"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7756f797074341b993192bb115457cdf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7756f797074341b993192bb115457cdf"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1a7366ba8d23449d91515036583cef23", "title": "Protein expression in tension wood formation monitored at high tissue resolution in Populus", "authors": [{"family": "Bygdell", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Srivastava", "given": "Vaibhav", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Obudulu", "given": "Ogonna", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Srivastava", "given": "Manoj K", "initials": "MK"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sundberg", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Trygg", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mellerowicz", "given": "Ewa J", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Wingsle", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-06-15", "journal": {"volume": "68", "issn": "0022-0957", "issue": "13", "pages": "3405-3417", "title": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/jxb/erx186", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1a7366ba8d23449d91515036583cef23.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1a7366ba8d23449d91515036583cef23"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "420b235c51914d58af7a8184175a8059", "title": "Microbial Community Structure in a Serpentine-Hosted Abiotic Gas Seepage at the Chimaera Ophiolite, Turkey.", "authors": [{"family": "Neubeck", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sun", "given": "Li", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "M\u00fcller", "given": "Bettina", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Ivarsson", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hosg\u00f6rmez", "given": "Hakan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "\u00d6zcan", "given": "Dogacan", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Broman", "given": "Curt", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Schn\u00fcrer", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-06-15", "journal": {"volume": "83", "issn": "1098-5336", "issue": "12", "title": "Appl.

We describe the influence of the liquid chemistry, mineralogy, and H2 and CH4 levels on the bacterial community structure in a semidry, exposed, ultramafic environment. The bacterial and archaeal community structures were monitored using Illumina sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. At all sampling points, four phyla, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria, accounted for the majority of taxa. Members of the Chloroflexi phylum dominated low-diversity sites, whereas Proteobacteria dominated high-diversity sites. Methane, nitrogen, iron, and hydrogen oxidizers were detected as well as archaea and metal-resistant bacteria.IMPORTANCE Our study is a comprehensive microbial investigation of the Chimaera ophiolite. DNA has been extracted from 16 sites in the area and has been studied from microbial and geochemical points of view. We describe a microbial community structure that is dependent on terrestrial, serpentinization-driven abiotic H2, which is poorly studied due to the rarity of these environments on Earth.", "doi":

HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4).

treatment. Brain metastases (BMs) are among the most common mass lesions in the brain that are resistant to chemotherapies, have a very poor prognosis, and currently lack any efficient diagnostic tests. Predictions estimate that about 40% of lung and breast cancer patients will develop BM. Despite this, very little is known about the immunological and genetic aberrations that drive tumorigenesis in BM. In this study, we demonstrate the infiltration of mast cells (MCs) in a large cohort of human BM samples with different tissues of origin for primary cancer. We applied patient-derived BM cell models to the study of BM cell-MC interactions. BM cells when cocultured with MCs demonstrate enhanced growth and self-renewal capacity. Gene set enrichment analyses indicate increased expression of signal transduction and transmembrane proteins related genes in the cocultured BM cells. MCs exert their effect by release of mediators such as IL-8, IL-10, matrix metalloprotease 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby permitting metastasis. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of MCs in BM. Our findings indicate MCs' capability of modulating gene expression in BM cells and suggest that MCs can serve as a new target for drug development against metastases in the brain.", "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2017.00115", "pmid": "28626727", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5454042"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1aef5d2c4709404bb4b18ad91957495f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/1aef5d2c4709404bb4b18ad91957495f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3a3c6631eadb4decbde40c86edda9348", "title": "Genome Sequence of Roseovarius mucosus Strain SMR3, Isolated from a Culture of the Diatom Skeletonema marinoi.", "authors": [{"family": "T\u00f6pel", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pinder", "given": "Matthew I M", "initials": "MIM"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Oskar N", "initials": "ON"}, {"family": "Kourtchenko", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Godhe", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Clarke", "given": "Adrian K", "initials": "AK"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-06-01", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2169-8287", "issue": "22", "title": "Genome Announc"}, "abstract": "We present the genome of Roseovarius mucosus strain SMR3, a marine bacterium isolated from the diatom Skeletonema marinoi strain RO5AC sampled from top layer sediments at 14\u00a0m depth.

We then examined variability in transporter density across brain regions, matter, and disease using two cohorts of post-mortem brains from Alzheimer's disease patients and age-matched controls. Changes in transporter density were also investigated in capillaries near plaques and on the mRNA level. P-glycoprotein density varied with brain region and matter, whereas ABCG2 density varied with brain matter. In temporal cortex, P-glycoprotein density was 53% lower in Alzheimer's disease samples than in controls, and was reduced by 35% in capillaries near plaque deposits within Alzheimer's disease samples. ABCG2 density was unaffected in Alzheimer's disease. No differences were detected at the transcript level.

In this study, comprising 67 HD male patients and 39 male healthy volunteers, we aimed to identify HPA-axis coupled CpG-sites, in which modifications of the epigenetic profile are associated with hypersexuality. The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip, measuring the methylation state of over 850K CpG sites. Prior to analysis, the global DNA methylation pattern was pre-processed according to standard protocols and adjusted for white blood cell type heterogeneity. We included CpG sites located within 2000bp of the transcriptional start site of the following HPA-axis coupled genes: Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2), FKBP5 and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). We performed multiple linear regression models of methylation M-values to a categorical variable of hypersexuality, adjusting for depression, dexamethasone non-suppression status, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire total score and plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Of 76 tested individual CpG sites, four were nominally significant (p<0.05), associated with the genes CRH, CRHR2 and NR3C1. Cg23409074-located 48bp upstream of the transcription start site of the CRH gene - was significantly hypomethylated in hypersexual patients after corrections for multiple testing using the FDR-method. Methylation levels of cg23409074 were positively correlated with gene expression of the CRH gene in an independent cohort of 11 healthy male subjects. The methylation levels at the identified CRH site, cg23409074, were significantly correlated between blood and four different brain regions.

Cubilin is a membrane protein expressed in the proximal renal tubule. Cubilin and megalin function together as endocytic receptors mediating uptake of many proteins. There is no established predictive marker for metastatic renal cell cancer patients and the purpose of the present study was to assess if cubilin can predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\nCubilin protein expression was analyzsed in tumor tissue from a cohort of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (n\u2009=\u2009139) using immunohistochemistry. One hundred and thirty six of the patients were treated with sunitinib or sorafenib in the first- or second-line setting. Thirty of these were censored because of toxicity leading to the termination of treatment and the remaining (n\u2009=\u2009106) were selected for the current study.\n\nFifty-three (50%) of the tumors expressed cubilin in the membrane. The median progression-free survival was 8\u00a0months in patients with cubilin expressing tumors and 4\u00a0months in the cubilin negative group. In addition, the overall survival was better for patients with cubilin positive tumors. We also found that the fraction of cubilin negative patients was significantly higher in the non-responding group (PFS \u22643\u00a0months) compared to responding patients (PFS >3\u00a0months).\n\nWe show for the first time that tumoral expression of cubilin is a positive predictive marker for treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer patients with sunitinib and sorafenib.", "doi": "10.1007/s00432-017-2365-y", "pmid": "28260162", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00432-017-2365-y"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5427164"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d4773ae4a45046d682911d0f085c4ac3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d4773ae4a45046d682911d0f085c4ac3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d704cde438624d95bc290a353f9f47c4", "title": "Separating the effects of forage source and field microbiota on silage fermentation quality and aerobic stability", "authors": [{"family": "Mogodiniyai Kasmaei", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dicksved", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sp\u00f6rndly", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ud\u00e9n", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-06-00", "journal": {"volume": null, "issn": "0142-5242", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "Grass Forage Sci"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1111/gfs.12238", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Collaborative", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d704cde438624d95bc290a353f9f47c4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d704cde438624d95bc290a353f9f47c4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "efc910bea38f4f88a004e0a8d58828eb", "title": "Lower inflammatory markers in women with antenatal depression brings the M1/M2 balance into focus from a new direction", "authors": [{"family": "Edvinsson", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Br\u00e4nn", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hellgren", "given": "Charlotte", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Freyhult", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "White", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kamali-Moghaddam", "given": "Masood", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Olivier", "given": "Jocelien", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bergquist", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bostr\u00f6m", "given": "Adrian E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Schi\u00f6th", "given": "Helgi B", "initials": "HB"}, {"family": "Skalkidou", "given": "Alkistis", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cunningham", "given": "Janet L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m-Poromaa", "given": "Inger", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "80", "issn": "0306-4530", "issue": null, "pages": "15-25", "title": "Psychoneuroendocrinology"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.02.027", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Clinical Biomarkers": "Service", "PLA Proteomics": "Collaborative", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/efc910bea38f4f88a004e0a8d58828eb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/efc910bea38f4f88a004e0a8d58828eb"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "feb578c0af8f44d999e4cdc360c28358", "title": "Affinity Proteomics Exploration of Melanoma Identifies Proteins in Serum with Associations to T-Stage and Recurrence.", "authors": [{"family": "Bystr\u00f6m", "given": "Sanna", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fredolini", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Edqvist", "given": "Per-Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Nyaiesh", "given": "Etienne-Nicholas", "initials": "EN"}, {"family": "Drobin", "given": "Kimi", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "10", "issn": "1936-5233", "issue": "3", "pages": "385-395", "title": "Transl Oncol"}, "abstract": "Blood-based proteomic profiling may aid and expand our understanding of diseases and their different phenotypes. The aim of the presented study was to profile serum samples from patients with malignant melanoma using affinity proteomic assays to describe proteins in the blood stream that are associated to stage or recurrence of melanoma.\n\nMultiplexed protein analysis was conducted using antibody suspension bead arrays. A total of 232 antibodies against 132 proteins were selected from (i) a screening with 4595 antibodies and 32 serum samples from melanoma patients and controls, (ii) antibodies used for immunohistochemistry, (iii) protein targets previously related with melanoma. The analysis was performed with 149 serum samples from patients with malignant melanoma. Antibody selectivity was then assessed by Western blot, immunocapture mass spectrometry, and epitope mapping. Lastly, indicative antibodies were applied for IHC analysis of melanoma tissues.\n\nSerum levels of regucalcin (RGN) and syntaxin 7 (STX7) were found to be lower in patients with both recurring tumors and a high Breslow's thickness (T-stage 3/4) compared to low thickness (T-stage 1/2) without disease recurrence. Serum levels of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1-like (MTHFD1L) were instead elevated in sera of T3/4 patients with recurrence. The analysis of tissue sections with S100A6 and MTHFD1L showed positive staining in a majority of patients with melanoma, and S100A6 was significantly associated to T-stage.\n\nOur findings provide a

Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments.

VAR2CSA is translationally repressed by an upstream open reading frame. In this study, we report that the P. falciparum translation enhancing factor (PTEF) relieves upstream open reading frame repression and thereby facilitates VAR2CSA translation. VAR2CSA protein levels in var2csa-transcribing parasites are dependent on the expression level of PTEF, and the alleviation of upstream open reading frame repression requires the proteolytic processing of PTEF by PfCalpain. Cleavage generates a C-terminal domain that contains a sterile-alpha-motif-like domain.

We hypothesized that chronic arsenic exposure alters gene expression, potentially by altering DNA methylation of genes encoding central components of the immune system. We therefore analyzed the transcriptomes (by RNA sequencing) and methylomes (by target-enrichment next-generation sequencing) of primary CD4-positive T cells from matched groups of four women each in the Argentinean Andes, with fivefold differences in urinary arsenic concentrations (median concentrations of urinary arsenic in the lower- and high-arsenic groups: 65 and 276 \u03bcg/l, respectively). Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide alterations of gene expression; principal component analysis indicated that the exposure explained 53% of the variance in gene expression among the top variable genes and 19% of 28,351 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) between the exposure groups. Key genes regulating the immune system, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, as well as genes related to the NF-kappa-beta complex, were significantly downregulated in the high-arsenic group. Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide DNA methylation; the high-arsenic group had 3% points higher genome-wide full methylation (>80% methylation) than the lower-arsenic group. Differentially methylated regions that were hyper-methylated in the high-arsenic group showed enrichment for immune-related gene ontologies that constitute the basic functions of CD4-positive T cells, such as isotype switching and lymphocyte activation and differentiation. In conclusion, chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was related to changes in the transcriptome and methylome of CD4-positive T cells, both genome wide and in specific genes, supporting the hypothesis that arsenic causes immunotoxicity by interfering with gene expression and regulation.", "doi": "10.1007/s00204-016-1879-4", "pmid": "27838757", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00204-016-1879-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5399044"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3932c9f238004aaa8daf5320158c70ff.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3932c9f238004aaa8daf5320158c70ff"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4eab694bf7e14ca5a71b01cb978a023a", "title": "Further evidence for specific IFIH1 mutation as a cause of Singleton-Merten syndrome with phenotypic heterogeneity.", "authors": [{"family": "Pettersson", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bergendal", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Norderyd", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Anderlid", "given": "Britt-Marie", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Nordgren", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lindstrand", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "173", "issn": "1552-4833", "issue": "5", "pages": "1396-1399", "title": "Am.

In this study, we assess the impact of large tandem repeat arrays on the recombination rate landscape in an avian speciation model, the Eurasian crow. We assembled two high-quality genome references using single-molecule real-time sequencing (long-read assembly [LR]) and single-molecule optical maps (optical map assembly [OM]). A three-way comparison including the published short-read assembly (SR) constructed for the same individual allowed assessing assembly properties and pinpointing misassemblies. By combining information from all three assemblies, we characterized 36 previously unidentified large repetitive regions in the proximity of sequence assembly breakpoints, the majority of which contained complex arrays of a 14-kb satellite repeat or its 1.2-kb subunit. Using whole-genome population resequencing data, we estimated the population-scaled recombination rate (\u03c1) and found it to be significantly reduced in these regions. These findings are consistent with an effect of low recombination in regions adjacent to centromeric or subtelomeric heterochromatin and add to our understanding of the processes generating widespread heterogeneity in genetic diversity and differentiation along the genome.

In recent years, progress has been made in the understanding of the genetics of acinar adenocarcinomas and at least seven genetically different subtypes have been identified. DAC is known to present at an advanced stage with a high rate of extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, and a decreased interval to biochemical recurrence and the development of metastatic disease, when compared to acinar adenocarcinoma. Our aim was to investigate the genetic profile of DAC to determine whether there is a genomic rationale for the aggressive behaviour associated with this tumor type. Frozen tissue from 11 cases of DAC with paired benign tissue was analysed. After DNA extraction, copy-number alteration analysis was performed, as well as identification of mutations and indels. We compared the fraction of the DAC genome with copy-number alteration to previous results from 74 primary acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate. The alteration rate in DAC was comparable to that of acinar adenocarcinoma of high Gleason score. DAC harbored somatic changes seen in advanced and/or metastatic castration-resistant acinar adenocarcinoma, which likely accounts for its aggressive biological behavior.", "doi": "10.1016/j.humpath.2017.04.015", "pmid": "28457729", "labels": {"Clinical Genomics Stockholm": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0046-8177(17)30133-8"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5a18fd49e87041caa8d096732e5282cd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5a18fd49e87041caa8d096732e5282cd"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9405f119832b4231a5f50c1dff6cd6c5", "title": "Does the sex of one's co-twin affect height and BMI in adulthood?

There is increasing concern that exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) during pregnancy can adversely affect fetal development. It is well known that the size, charge, and chemistry of a nanoparticle can modulate embryological development. The role that particle morphology plays on early development, however, is still widely unknown. The present study aims to investigate the effect of hydroxyapatite nanoparticle (HANP) morphology on embryological development in a zebrafish exposure model. Four distinct HANP morphologies (dots, long rods, sheets, and fibers) were fabricated and characterized. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to HANPs (0-100 mg/L), and viability and developmental deformities were evaluated for up to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Malformations such as pericardial edema and axial curvature were apparent in embryos as early as 1 dpf, following exposure to the dot and fiber particles, and developed in embryos by 3 dpf in the sheet and long rod particle groups. Minimal death was observed in response to dot, long rod, and sheet particles (\u226425%), while fiber particles induced overwhelming toxicity (\u226460%) after 1 dpf, and complete toxicity during all subsequent time points. Collectively, these results suggest that nanoparticle morphology can significantly impact embryological development and should be a required consideration when designing nanomaterials for commercial use.", "doi": "10.3390/nano7040089", "pmid": "28441729", "labels": {"Genome Engineering Zebrafish": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nano7040089"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5408181"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bef52d22554945fcb511d0de18e687d9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/bef52d22554945fcb511d0de18e687d9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3ab08f7ce0d64e499b1282411ce8639c", "title": "Persistent Effects of Developmental Exposure to 17\u03b1-Ethinylestradiol on the Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Brain Transcriptome and Behavior", "authors": [{"family": "Porseryd", "given": "Tove", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Volkova", "given": "Kristina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Reyhanian Caspillo", "given": "Nasim", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "K\u00e4llman", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Dinnetz", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Porsh H\u00e4llstr\u00f6m", "given": "Inger", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-04-20", "journal": {"volume": "11", "issn": "1662-5153", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "Front.

We studied 2 families with cytopenia, predisposition to MDS with chromosome 7 aberrations, immunodeficiency, and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Genetic studies uncovered heterozygous missense mutations in SAMD9L, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome arm 7q. Consistent with a gain-of-function effect, ectopic expression of the 2 identified SAMD9L mutants decreased cell proliferation relative to wild-type protein. Of the 10 individuals identified who were heterozygous for either SAMD9L mutation, 3 developed MDS upon loss of the mutated SAMD9L allele following intracellular infections associated with myeloid, B-, and natural killer (NK)-cell deficiency. Five other individuals, 3 with spontaneously resolved cytopenic episodes in infancy, harbored hematopoietic revertant mosaicism by uniparental disomy of 7q, with loss of the mutated allele or additional in cisSAMD9L truncating mutations. Examination of 1 individual indicated that somatic reversions were postnatally selected. Somatic mutations were tracked to CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, being further enriched in B and NK cells. Stimulation of these cell types with interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 induced SAMD9L expression. Clinically, revertant mosaicism was associated with milder disease, yet neurological manifestations persisted in 3 individuals. Two carriers also harbored a rare, in trans germ line SAMD9L missense loss-of-function variant, potentially counteracting the SAMD9L mutation. Our results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor SAMD9L cause cytopenia, immunodeficiency, variable neurological presentation, and predisposition to MDS with -7/del(7q), whereas hematopoietic revertant mosaicism commonly ameliorated clinical manifestations.

The patient was compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in BCS1L, c.306A\u2009>\u2009T and c.399delA. In the cerebral cortex a specific pattern of astrogliosis and widespread loss of microglia was observed. Further analysis showed loss of Kupffer cells in the liver.

High methane removal efficiencies are well documented in marine environments, whereas anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) was only recently indicated as an important methane sink in freshwater systems. Freshwater AOM-mediating microorganisms lack taxonomic identification and only little is known about metabolic adaptions to prevailing biogeochemical conditions. One of the first study sites providing information about AOM activity in freshwater sediment is Lake \u00d8rn, a low-sulfate, iron-rich Danish lake. With the aim to identify freshwater AOM-mediating archaea, we incubated AOM-active anoxic, nitrate-free freshwater sediment from Lake \u00d8rn with (13)C-labeled methane ((13)CCH4) and (13)C-labeled bicarbonate ((13)CDIC) and followed the assimilation of (13)C into RNA by stable isotope probing. While AOM was active, (13)CCH4 and probably also (13)CDIC were incorporated into uncultured archaea of the Methanosarcinales-related cluster ANME-2d, whereas other known ANME lineages were not detected. This finding strongly suggests that ANME-2d archaea perform AOM coupled to sulfate and/or iron reduction and may have the capability of mixed assimilation of CH4 and DIC.

We demonstrate that serglycin is expressed in glioma and that increased expression predicts poor survival of patients. Analysis of serglycin expression in a large cohort of low- and high-grade human glioma samples reveals that its expression is grade dependent and is positively correlated with mast cell (MC) infiltration. Moreover, serglycin expression in patient-derived glioma cells is significantly increased upon MC co-culture. This is also accompanied by increased expression of CXCL12, CXCL10, as well as markers of cancer progression, including CD44, ZEB1 and vimentin.In conclusion, these findings indicate the importance of infiltrating MCs in glioma by modulating signaling cascades involving serglycin, CD44 and ZEB1. The present investigation reveals serglycin as a potential prognostic marker for glioma and demonstrates an association with the extent of MC recruitment and glioma progression, uncovering potential future therapeutic opportunities for patients.", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.15820", "pmid": "28445977", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "15820"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5421891"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a08f9ad01e8e4304bb3dbff907529404.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a08f9ad01e8e4304bb3dbff907529404"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9fd7c4c065ca4249814b1ab5b42d8246", "title": "Genome-wide identification of physically clustered genes suggests chromatin-level co-regulation in male reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana", "authors": [{"family": "Reimeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kundu", "given": "Snehangshu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pendle", "given": "Ali", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Irish", "given": "Vivian F", "initials": "VF"}, {"family": "Shaw", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Nakayama", "given": "Naomi", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jens F", "initials": "JF"}, {"family": "Emanuelsson", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-04-07", "journal": {"volume": "45", "issn": "0305-1048", "issue": "6", "pages": "3253-3265", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkx087", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9fd7c4c065ca4249814b1ab5b42d8246.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9fd7c4c065ca4249814b1ab5b42d8246"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f6ff44cbb6cb43d4ad682c875c41495c", "title": "SPlinted Ligation Adapter Tagging (SPLAT), a novel library preparation method for whole genome bisulphite sequencing", "authors": [{"family": "Raine", "given": "Amanda", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Manlig", "given": "Erika", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Wahlberg", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Syv\u00e4nen", "given": "Ann Christine", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Nordlund", "given": "Jessica", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-04-07", "journal": {"volume": "45", "issn": "0305-1048", "issue": "6", "pages": "e36-e36", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkw1110", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6ff44cbb6cb43d4ad682c875c41495c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f6ff44cbb6cb43d4ad682c875c41495c"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "28528687ee0e4b6baf2aa786d22d9983", "title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Six Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae from Serotypes 5, 6A, 6B, 18C, 19A, and 23F.", "authors": [{"family": "Jakobsson", "given": "Hedvig E", "initials": "HE"}, {"family": "Salv\u00e0-Serra", "given": "Francisco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Thorell", "given": "Kaisa", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Roger", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gonzales-Sil\u00e8s", "given": "Lucia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Boulund", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Engstrand", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kristiansson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Moore", "given": "Edward R B", "initials": "ER"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-04-06", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "2169-8287", "issue": "14", "title": "Genome Announc"}, "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a pathogenic bacterium found most commonly in the respiratory tract of humans and is a common cause of pneumonia and bacterial meningitis.

In combination with genotyping, such studies offer the prospect to 1) identify mechanisms involved with regulation of protein expression in plasma, and 2) determine whether the plasma proteins are likely to be causally implicated in disease. We report here the results of genome-wide association (GWA) studies of 83 proteins considered relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD), measured in 3,394 individuals with multiple CVD risk factors. We identified 79 genome-wide significant (p<5e-8) association signals, 55 of which replicated at P<0.0007 in separate validation studies (n = 2,639 individuals). Using automated text mining, manual curation, and network-based methods incorporating information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we propose plausible causal mechanisms for 25 trans-acting loci, including a potential post-translational regulation of stem cell factor by matrix metalloproteinase 9 and receptor-ligand pairs such as RANK-RANK ligand. Using public GWA study data, we further evaluate all 79 loci for their causal effect on coronary artery disease, and highlight several potentially causal associations.

PHP1B is associated with epigenetic changes at one or several differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) within GNAS, which encodes the \u03b1-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs\u03b1) and splice variants thereof. Heterozygous, maternally inherited STX16 or GNAS deletions leading to isolated loss-of-methylation (LOM) at exon A/B alone or at all maternal DMRs are the cause of autosomal dominant PHP1B (AD-PHP1B). In this study, we analyzed three affected individuals, the female proband and her two sons. All three revealed isolated LOM at GNAS exon A/B, whereas the proband's healthy maternal grandmother and uncle showed normal methylation at this locus. Haplotype analysis was consistent with linkage to the STX16/GNAS region, yet no deletion could be identified. Whole-genome sequencing of one of the patients revealed a large heterozygous inversion (1,882,433 bp). The centromeric breakpoint of the inversion is located 7,225 bp downstream of GNAS exon XL, but its DMR showed no methylation abnormality, raising the possibility that the inversion disrupts a regulatory element required only for establishing or maintaining exon A/B methylation. Because our three patients presented phenotypes consistent with PHP1B, and not with PHP1A, the Gs\u03b1 promoter is probably unaffected by the inversion. Our findings expand the spectrum of genetic mutations that lead to LOM at exon A/B alone and thus biallelic expression of the transcript derived from this alternative first GNAS exon. \u00a9 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.3083", "pmid": "28084650", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service", "Clinical Genomics Stockholm": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5395346"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS843464"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3a1cc06125b84310aade5d4e82d2ae12.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3a1cc06125b84310aade5d4e82d2ae12"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "582a1ec0dba34f4f83e8c24ff80a6284", "title": "Effects of dietary inclusion of the yeasts  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and  Wickerhamomyces anomalus  on gut microbiota of rainbow trout", "authors": [{"family": "Huyben", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Nyman", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vidakovi\u0107", "given": "Aleksandar", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Passoth", "given": "Volkmar", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Moccia", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kiessling", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dicksved", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lundh", "given": "Torbj\u00f6rn", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "473", "issn": "0044-8486", "issue": null, "pages": "528-537", "title": "Aquaculture"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.03.024", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/582a1ec0dba34f4f83e8c24ff80a6284.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/582a1ec0dba34f4f83e8c24ff80a6284"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5c60d95ec1144a3f84f4f35dbac8f469", "title": "Genomic analysis reveals the presence of a class D beta-lactamase with broad substrate specificity in animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species.", "authors": [{"family": "Zangenah", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "A F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "\u00d6zenci", "given": "V", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Bergman", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "36", "issn": "1435-4373", "issue": "4", "pages": "657-662", "title": "Eur.

We and others recently discovered two new Capnocytophaga species, C. canis and C. stomatis, mainly associated with wound infections. The first-line treatment of animal bite related infections is penicillin, and in case of allergy, doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, there is a lack of antibiotic susceptibility patterns for animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species. Thus, we \ufeffset out to study the antibiotic profiles against animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species isolated from wound and blood cultures after cat and dog bites and coupled the findings to whole genome sequencing data. A total of 24 strains were included in the study. Phenotypic analysis of antibiotic resistance was performed with E-tests. The web-based tool 'Resfinder' was used to identify resistance genes in the whole genome dataset. Two strains of C. cynodegmi and two strains of the recently discovered C. stomatis were resistant to penicillin (MIC\u2009> 24 mg\ufeff/L) and cephalosporins (MIC\u2009>\u200924 mg/\ufeffL), and three out of these strains also exhibited resistance to imipenem (MIC\u2009=\u200932 mg/\ufeffL). Genomic analysis revealed that these strains carried a class D beta-lactamase gene, which has not previously been found in Capnocytophaga spp. A class D beta lactamase with broad substrate specificity was found in animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species, which could have important implications when treating wound infections after cat and dog bites.

Here we utilised RNA-Sequencing to assay gene expression in winter buds undergoing bud flush in a natural population of Populus tremula, an outbreeding forest tree species. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, with local eQTLs having significantly higher effect sizes. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated the relationship between network topology, the genetic architecture of gene expression and signatures of selection. Within the co-expression network, eGenes were underrepresented in network module cores (hubs) and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We additionally found that module core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint on coding and non-coding sequence, with connectivity associated with signatures of selection.

In normal tissue, FZD10 levels are generally very low; however, its upregulation in synovial carcinoma has attracted some attention for therapy. Our findings identify FZD10 as a receptor interacting with and signalling through the heterotrimeric G protein G\u03b113 but not G\u03b112, G\u03b1i1, G\u03b1oA, G\u03b1s, or G\u03b1q.

Furthermore, we show that FZD10 mediates G\u03b112/13 activation-dependent induction of YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity. In addition, we show a distinct expression of FZD10 in embryonic CNS endothelial cells at E11.5-E14.5.

Both patients developed humoral and cellular (ie, HLA-A*01:01-restricted) immune responses directed against 2 novel tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), INO80E and UCLH3 after HSCT. Both TAAs were highly expressed in the original tumor tissue suggesting that HSCT promoted a clinically relevant, long-lasting cellular immune response. In contrast to untreated controls, who succumbed to progressive disease, both patients are tumor-free 9 years after diagnosis. Radical surgery combined with HSCT may cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma and change the cellular immune repertoire capable of responding to clinically and biologically relevant TAAs.", "doi": "10.1097/CJI.0000000000000164", "pmid": "28338506", "labels": {"Autoimmunity Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ffaed83ff04c4f058b2fb20f13022ba5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ffaed83ff04c4f058b2fb20f13022ba5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0990de43373146d69c60334dffbe0590", "title": "The evolutionary and phylogeographic history of woolly mammoths: a comprehensive mitogenomic analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Chang", "given": "Dan", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Knapp", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Enk", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lippold", "given": "Sebastian", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kircher", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lister", "given": "Adrian", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "MacPhee", "given": "Ross D E", "initials": "RD"}, {"family": "Widga", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Czechowski", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Sommer", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hodges", "given": "Emily", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "St\u00fcmpel", "given": "Nikolaus", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Barnes", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Dal\u00e9n", "given": "Love", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Derevianko", "given": "Anatoly", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Germonpr\u00e9", "given": "Mietje", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hillebrand-Voiculescu", "given": "Alexandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Constantin", "given": "Silviu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kuznetsova", "given": "Tatyana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Mol", "given": "Dick", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Rathgeber", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Rosendahl", "given": "Wilfried", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Tikhonov", "given": "Alexey N", "initials": "AN"}, {"family": "Willerslev", "given": "Eske", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hannon", "given": "Greg", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lalueza-Fox", "given": "Carles", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Joger", "given": "Ulrich", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Poinar", "given": "Hendrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Hofreiter", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Shapiro", "given": "Beth", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-03-22", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "44585", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Near the end of the Pleistocene epoch, populations of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) were distributed across parts of three continents, from western Europe and northern Asia through Beringia to the Atlantic seaboard of North America. Nonetheless, questions about the connectivity and temporal continuity of mammoth populations and species remain unanswered. We use a combination of targeted enrichment and high-throughput sequencing to assemble and interpret a data set of 143 mammoth mitochondrial genomes, sampled from fossils recovered from across their Holarctic range. Our dataset includes 54 previously unpublished mitochondrial genomes and significantly increases the coverage of the Eurasian range of the species. The resulting global phylogeny confirms that the Late Pleistocene mammoth population comprised three distinct mitochondrial lineages that began to diverge ~1.0-2.0 million years ago (Ma). We also find that mammoth mitochondrial lineages were strongly geographically partitioned throughout the Pleistocene. In combination, our genetic results and the pattern of morphological variation in time and space suggest that male-mediated gene flow, rather than large-scale dispersals, was important in the Pleistocene evolutionary history of mammoths.", "doi": "10.1038/srep44585", "pmid": "28327635", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "srep44585"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5361112"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0990de43373146d69c60334dffbe0590.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0990de43373146d69c60334dffbe0590"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "be33ec0e3ee447298b828ebbd839157a", "title": "Atrophin controls developmental signaling pathways via interactions with Trithorax-like", "authors": [{"family": "Yeung", "given": "Kelvin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Boija", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Edvin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Holmqvist", "given": "Per Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Tsatskis", "given": "Yonit", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Nisoli", "given": "Ilaria", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Yap", "given": "Damian", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lorzadeh", "given": "Alireza", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Moksa", "given": "Michelle", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hirst", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Aparicio", "given": "Samuel", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fanto", "given": "Manolis", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Stenberg", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mannervik", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "McNeill", "given": "Helen", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-03-22", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "2050-084X", "issue": null, "pages": null, "title": "Elife"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.7554/elife.23084", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/be33ec0e3ee447298b828ebbd839157a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/be33ec0e3ee447298b828ebbd839157a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "462837a655434c04a22ffd076f56c646", "title": "Proteogenomics produces comprehensive and highly accurate protein-coding gene annotation in a complete genome assembly of Malassezia sympodialis.", "authors": [{"family": "Zhu", "given": "Yafeng", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Engstr\u00f6m", "given": "P\u00e4r G", "initials": "PG"}, {"family": "Tellgren-Roth", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Baudo", "given": "Charles D", "initials": "CD"}, {"family": "Kennell", "given": "John C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Sun", "given": "Sheng", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Billmyre", "given": "R Blake", "initials": "RB"}, {"family": "Schr\u00f6der", "given": "Markus S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Holm", "given": "Tina", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sigurgeirsson", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Guangxi", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sankaranarayanan", "given": "Sundar Ram", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Siddharthan", "given": "Rahul", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sanyal", "given": "Kaustuv", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nystedt", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Boekhout", "given": "Teun", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Dawson", "given": "Thomas L", "initials": "TL"}, {"family": "Heitman", "given": "Joseph", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Scheynius", "given": "Annika", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lehti\u00f6", "given": "Janne", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-03-17", "journal": {"volume": "45", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "5", "pages": "2629-2643", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "Complete and accurate genome assembly and annotation is a crucial foundation for comparative and functional genomics.

Through long-read DNA sequencing, we obtained a gap-free genome assembly for M. sympodialis (ATCC 42132), comprising eight nuclear and one mitochondrial chromosome. We also sequenced and assembled four M. sympodialis clinical isolates, and showed their value for understanding Malassezia reproduction by confirming four alternative allele combinations at the two mating-type loci. Importantly, we demonstrated how proteomics data could be readily integrated with transcriptomics data in standard annotation tools. This increased the number of annotated protein-coding genes by 14% (from 3612 to 4113), compared to using transcriptomics evidence alone. Manual curation further increased the number of protein-coding genes by 9% (to 4493). All of these genes have RNA-seq evidence and 87% were confirmed by proteomics.

While having been extensively studied by archaeology, very little is known about their genetic identity. To fill this gap, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Scythians of the North Pontic Region (NPR) and successfully retrieved 19 whole mtDNA genomes. We have identified three potential mtDNA lineage ancestries of the NPR Scythians tracing back to hunter-gatherer and nomadic populations of east and west Eurasia as well as the Neolithic farming expansion into Europe. One third of all mt lineages in our dataset belonged to subdivisions of mt haplogroup U5. A comparison of NPR Scythian mtDNA linages with other contemporaneous Scythian groups, the Saka and the Pazyryks, reveals a common mtDNA package comprised of haplogroups H/H5, U5a, A, D/D4, and F1/F2. Of these, west Eurasian lineages show a downward cline in the west-east direction while east Eurasian haplogroups display the opposite trajectory. An overall similarity in mtDNA lineages of the NPR Scythians was found with the late Bronze Age Srubnaya population of the Northern Black Sea region which supports the archaeological hypothesis suggesting Srubnaya people as ancestors of the NPR Scythians.", "doi": "10.1038/srep43950", "pmid": "28266657", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "srep43950"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5339713"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/233b062d1f5d47e5ac0971cd9ea0a47f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/233b062d1f5d47e5ac0971cd9ea0a47f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "87340c9a3cf84389a738d51e8c157012", "title": "Method to Visualize and Analyze Membrane Interacting Proteins by Transmission Electron Microscopy", "authors": [{"family": "B.

A set of ten plasma and serum samples from subjects with multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and without any disease diagnosis were profiled on a peptide array representing the whole proteome, hosting 2.2 million 12-mer peptides with a six amino acid lateral shift. On the basis of the IgG reactivities found on these whole-proteome peptide microarrays, a set of 23 samples was then studied on a targeted array with 174\u202f000 12-mer peptides of single amino acid lateral shift. Finally, verification of IgG reactivities was conducted with a larger sample set (n = 448) using the bead-based peptide microarrays. The presented workflow employed three different peptide microarray formats to discover and resolve the epitopes of human autoantibodies and revealed two potentially new autoantigens: MAP3K7 in multiple sclerosis and NRXN1 in narcolepsy.

However, we expect sexual dimorphism in transcription to be dynamic and dependent on factors such as reproductive status. Mating induces many behavioral and physiological changes distinct to each sex and is therefore expected to activate regulatory changes in many sex-biased genes. Here, we first characterized sexual dimorphism in gene expression in Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles. We then examined how females and males respond to mating and how it affects sex-biased expression, both in sex-limited (abdomen) and sex-shared (head and thorax) tissues. Mating responses were largely sex-specific and, as expected, females showed more genes responding compared with males (\u223c2,000 vs. \u223c300 genes in the abdomen, \u223c500 vs. \u223c400 in the head and thorax, respectively). Of the sex-biased genes present in virgins, 16% (1,041 genes) in the abdomen and 17% (243 genes) in the head and thorax altered their relative expression between the sexes as a result of mating. Sex-bias status changed in 2% of the genes in the abdomen and 4% in the head and thorax following mating. Mating responses involved de-feminization of females and, to a lesser extent, de-masculinization of males relative to their virgin state: mating decreased rather than increased dimorphic expression of sex-biased genes. The fact that regulatory changes of both types of sex-biased genes occurred in both sexes suggests that male- and female-specific selection is not restricted to male- and female-biased genes, respectively, as is sometimes assumed.", "doi": "10.1093/gbe/evx029", "pmid": "28391318", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "3039479"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6bc70b0130924ae9bc7190acaeb79387.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6bc70b0130924ae9bc7190acaeb79387"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0d12224d115c4264913af93ddf48ea97", "title": "Towards a whole-genome sequence for rye (Secale cereale L.).", "authors": [{"family": "Bauer", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Schmutzer", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Barilar", "given": "Ivan", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Mascher", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gundlach", "given": "Heidrun", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Martis", "given": "Mihaela M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Twardziok", "given": "Sven O", "initials": "SO"}, {"family": "Hackauf", "given": "Bernd", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Gordillo", "given": "Andres", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wilde", "given": "Peer", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Schmidt", "given": "Malthe", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Korzun", "given": "Viktor", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Mayer", "given": "Klaus F X", "initials": "KF"}, {"family": "Schmid", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sch\u00f6n", "given": "Chris-Carolin", "initials": "CC"}, {"family": "Scholz", "given": "Uwe", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "89", "issn": "1365-313X", "issue": "5", "pages": "853-869", "title": "Plant J."}, "abstract": "We report on a whole-genome draft sequence of rye (Secale cereale L.).

Four SNPs within the APOE cluster (rs7412, rs4420638), ABCC2 (rs2002042) and CELSR/SORT1/PSRC1 (rs646776), displayed a major impact on statin efficacy. The wGRS was significantly associated with lower LDL-C at age 75 and 80. This association was replicated displaying similar results.

A strong positive trend was found between local relative abundance and occupancy of populations. Notably, the occupancy-frequency distributions were significantly bimodal with a satellite mode of rare endemic populations and a core mode of abundant cosmopolitan populations (e.g. Synechococcus, SAR11 and SAR86 clade members). Temporal changes in population distributions supported several theoretical frameworks. Still, bimodality was found among bacterioplankton communities across the entire Baltic Sea, and was also frequent in globally distributed datasets. Datasets spanning waters with widely different physicochemical characteristics or environmental gradients typically lacked significant bimodal patterns. When such datasets were divided into subsets with coherent environmental conditions, bimodal patterns emerged, highlighting the importance of positive feedbacks between local abundance and occupancy within specific biomes.

We therefore investigated the associations between 80 cardiovascular proteins and the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). Methods We used a discovery/replication approach in two independent community-based cohorts of elderly patients: the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men ( n\u2009=\u2009662; mean age 78 years) and the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( n\u2009=\u2009757; mean age 75 years; 51% women). A proteomic chip with a panel of 80 plasma proteins associated with different aspects of cardiovascular disease was analysed. In the discovery cohort, we used a false discovery rate of 5% to take into account the multiple statistical testing. Nominal p values were used in the replication. Results Higher levels of T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-1, placenta growth factor, growth/differentiation factor-15, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor and kallikrein-11 were robustly associated with a higher ACR in both cohorts in multivariable linear regression models adjusted for sex, established cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive treatment, prevalent cardiovascular disease and glomerular filtration rate ( p\u2009<\u20090.02 for all). All associations were also significant in separate analyses of patients without diabetes. Conclusions We discovered and replicated associations between ACR and five cardiovascular proteins involved in tubular injury, atherosclerosis, endothelial function, heart failure, inflammation, glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury.

We first investigated the impact of two essential drug transporters separately, one influx transporter (OATP1B1; SLCO1B1) and one efflux transporter (P-gp; ABCB1), in cells overexpressing these proteins. We showed that OATP1B1 increased Fic of its substrates, while P-gp decreased Fic. We then investigated the impact of the concerted action of multiple transporters and metabolizing enzymes in freshly-isolated human hepatocytes in culture configurations with different levels of expression and activity of these proteins. We observed that Fic was up to 35-fold lower in the configuration with high expression of drug-eliminating transporters and enzymes. We conclude that Fic provides a measurement of the net impact of all cellular drug disposition processes on intracellular bioavailable drug levels.

Yield of CH4 varies between individuals despite identical feeding conditions. To get a better understanding of factors behind the individual variation, 73 dairy cows given the same feed but differing in CH4 emissions were investigated with focus on fiber digestion, fermentation end products and bacterial and archaeal composition. In total 21 cows (12 Holstein, 9 Swedish Red) identified as persistent low, medium or high CH4 emitters over a 3 month period were furthermore chosen for analysis of microbial community structure in rumen fluid. This was assessed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene and by quantitative qPCR of targeted Methanobrevibacter groups. The results showed a positive correlation between low CH4 emitters and higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium clade. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level of bacteria showed two distinct clusters (P < 0.01) that were related to CH4 production. One cluster was associated with low CH4 production (referred to as cluster L) whereas the other cluster was associated with high CH4 production (cluster H) and the medium emitters occurred in both clusters. The differences between clusters were primarily linked to differential abundances of certain OTUs belonging to Prevotella. Moreover, several OTUs belonging to the family Succinivibrionaceae were dominant in samples belonging to cluster L. Fermentation pattern of volatile fatty acids showed that proportion of propionate was higher in cluster L, while proportion of butyrate was higher in cluster H. No difference was found in milk production or organic matter digestibility between cows. Cows in cluster L had lower CH4/kg energy corrected milk (ECM) compared to cows in cluster H, 8.3 compared to 9.7 g CH4/kg ECM, showing that low CH4 cows utilized the feed more efficient for milk production which might indicate a more efficient microbial population or host genetic differences that is reflected in bacterial and archaeal (or methanogens) populations.", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2017.00226", "pmid": "28261182", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5313486"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7168b95dce2a405386fcbade449d4999.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7168b95dce2a405386fcbade449d4999"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "171899c09f704f0499506bbae6f97a8e", "title": "Comparison of whole genome amplification techniques for human single cell exome sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Borgstr\u00f6m", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Paterlini", "given": "Marta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mold", "given": "Jeff E", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Frisen", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2017-02-16", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "2", "pages": "e0171566", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Whole genome amplification (WGA) is currently a prerequisite for single cell whole genome or exome sequencing.

Accordingly, they are devoid of introns, are transcribed as polycistrons and contain very little intergenic sequences. Usually, vertebrate mitochondrial genomes measure between 16.5 and 17 kilobases (kb).\n\nDuring genome sequencing projects for two novel vertebrate models, the invasive round goby and the sand goby, we found that the sand goby genome is exceptionally small (16.4\u00a0kb), while the mitochondrial genome of the round goby is much larger than expected for a vertebrate. It is 19\u00a0kb in size and is thus one of the largest fish and even vertebrate mitochondrial genomes known to date. The expansion is attributable to a sequence insertion downstream of the putative transcriptional start site. This insertion carries traces of repeats from the control region, but is mostly novel. To get more information about this phenomenon, we gathered all available mitochondrial genomes of Gobiidae and of nine gobioid species, performed phylogenetic analyses, analysed gene arrangements, and compared gobiid mitochondrial genome sizes, ecological information and other species characteristics with respect to the mitochondrial phylogeny. This allowed us amongst others to identify a unique arrangement of tRNAs among Ponto-Caspian gobies.\n\nOur results indicate that the round goby mitochondrial genome may contain novel features. Since mitochondrial genome organisation is tightly linked to energy metabolism, these features may be linked to its invasion success. Also, the unique tRNA arrangement among Ponto-Caspian gobies may be helpful in studying the evolution of this highly adaptive and invasive species group.

The NMRD profiles are interpreted by means of a simple relaxation model based on the inter- and intra-ionic dipole-dipole relaxation mechanism. Using an atomic molecular-ion dynamic simulation at 323 K the relevant spin dipole-dipole (DD) correlation functions are calculated. The results indicate that the NMRD profiles can be rationalized using intra- and inter-ionic spin DD interactions, however, anions are mainly modulated by ionic reorientation because of temporary correlations with cations, where modulation by translational diffusion plays a minor role. Reorientational dynamics of charge-neutral ion couples (i.e. [C4mim][PF6]) and [C4mim](+) ions are in the nano-second (ns) time range whereas the reorientation of [PF6](-) is characterized by a reorientational correlation time in the pico-second (ps) regime. Based on the NMRD profiles we conclude that the main relaxation mechanism for [PF6](-) is due to fast internal reorientational motion, a partially averaged F-F intra- and F-H inter-ionic DD coupling as the anion resides in close proximity to its temporary oppositely charged cation partner. The F-T1-NMRD data display a ns dispersion which is interpreted as being due to correlated reorientational modulations resulting from the H-containing charge-neutral ion couple [C4mim][PF6]. The analysis of ionicity is based on the free anion fraction, f, and it increases with temperature with f \u2192 1 at the highest temperatures investigated. The fraction is obtained from the H-F NMRD profiles as correlated-non-correlated dynamics of the ions. The analysis of T1 relaxation rates of C, H, F and P at high fields cannot generally give the fraction of ions but is consistent with the interpretation based on the NMRD profiles with relaxation contributions due to DD-intra and -inter, CSA-intra (and -inter for C), including spin rotation for P.

Given prior evidence of heterogeneity by age at onset in MDD, we tested whether genome-wide significant risk variants for MDD could be identified in cases subdivided by age at onset.\n\nDiscovery case-control genome-wide association studies were performed where cases were stratified using increasing/decreasing age-at-onset cutoffs; significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested in nine independent replication samples, giving a total sample of 22,158 cases and 133,749 control subjects for subsetting. Polygenic score analysis was used to examine whether differences in shared genetic risk exists between earlier and adult-onset MDD with commonly comorbid disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and coronary artery disease.\n\nWe identified one replicated genome-wide significant locus associated with adult-onset (>27 years) MDD (rs7647854, odds ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.21, p = 5.2 \u00d7 10(-11)). Using polygenic score analyses, we show that earlier-onset MDD is genetically more similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than adult-onset MDD.\n\nWe demonstrate that using additional phenotype data previously collected by genetic studies to tackle phenotypic heterogeneity in MDD can successfully lead to the discovery of genetic risk factor despite reduced sample size.

Particularly in nutrient-poor peatlands, CH4 production can be low and exceeded by carbon dioxide (CO2) production from unresolved anaerobic processes. To clarify the role anaerobic bacterial degraders play in this variation, we compared consumers of cellobiose-derived carbon in two fens differing in nutrient status and the ratio of CO2 to CH4 produced. After [(13)C]cellobiose amendment, the mesotrophic fen produced equal amounts of CH4 and CO2 The oligotrophic fen had lower CH4 production but produced 3 to 59 times more CO2 than CH4 RNA stable-isotope probing revealed that in the mesotrophic fen with higher CH4 production, cellobiose-derived carbon was mainly assimilated by various recognized fermenters of Firmicutes and by Proteobacteria The oligotrophic peat with excess CO2 production revealed a wider variety of cellobiose-C consumers, including Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but also more unconventional degraders, such as Telmatobacter-related Acidobacteria and subphylum 3 of Verrucomicrobia Prominent and potentially fermentative Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi did not appear to process cellobiose-C. Our results show that anaerobic degradation resulting in different levels of CH4 production can involve distinct sets of bacterial degraders. By distinguishing cellobiose degraders from the total community, this study contributes to defining anaerobic bacteria that process cellulose-derived carbon in peat. Several of the identified degraders, particularly fermenters and potential Fe(III) or humic substance reducers in the oligotrophic peat, represent promising candidates for resolving the origin of excess CO2 production in peatlands.\n\nPeatlands are major sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), yet in many peatlands, CO2 production from unresolved anaerobic processes exceeds CH4 production. Anaerobic degradation produces the precursors of CH4 production but also represents competing processes. We show that anaerobic degradation leading to high or low CH4 production involved distinct sets of bacteria. Well-known fermenters dominated in a peatland with high CH4 production, while novel and unconventional degraders could be identified in a site where CO2 production greatly exceeds CH4 production. Our results help identify and assign functions to uncharacterized bacteria that promote or inhibit CH4 production and reveal bacteria potentially producing the excess CO2 in acidic peat.

Such a transect, spanning a salinity gradient from freshwater to the open sea, facilitated a broad genome-enabled investigation of natural as well as impacted aspects of Baltic Sea viral communities. Taxonomic signatures representative of phages within the widely distributed order Caudovirales were identified with enrichments in lesser-known families such as Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. The distribution of phage reported to infect diverse and ubiquitous heterotrophic bacteria (SAR11 clades) and cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp.) displayed population-level shifts in diversity. Samples from higher-salinity conditions (>14 practical salinity units [PSU]) had increased abundances of viruses for picoeukaryotes, i.e., Ostreococcus. These data, combined with host diversity estimates, suggest viral modulation of diversity on the whole-community scale, as well as in specific prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages. RNA libraries revealed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA viral populations throughout the Baltic Sea, with ssDNA phage highly represented in Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk. Further, our data suggest relatively high transcriptional activity of fish viruses within diverse families known to have broad host ranges, such as Nodoviridae (RNA), Iridoviridae (DNA), and predicted zoonotic viruses that can cause ecological and economic damage as well as impact human health. IMPORTANCE Inferred virus-host relationships, community structures of ubiquitous ecologically relevant groups, and identification of transcriptionally active populations have been achieved with our Baltic Sea study. Further, these data, highlighting the transcriptional activity of viruses, represent one of the more powerful uses of omics concerning ecosystem health. The use of omics-related data to assess ecosystem health holds great promise for rapid and relatively inexpensive determination of perturbations and risk, explicitly with regard to viral assemblages, as no single marker gene is suitable for widespread taxonomic coverage.", "doi": "10.1128/mSystems.00125-16", "pmid": "28217745", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mSystems00125-16"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5309335"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/209932748e35452f8c3277616f4a166f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/209932748e35452f8c3277616f4a166f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "74fcedf830fe4da28feaf59862e5d126", "title": "A novel RNA sequencing data analysis method for cell line authentication.", "authors": [{"family": "Fasterius", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Raso", "given": "Cinzia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kennedy", "given": "Susan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rauch", "given": "Nora", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Lundin", "given": "P\u00e4r", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kolch", "given": "Walter", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Al-Khalili Szigyarto", "given": "Cristina", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-02-13", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "2", "pages": "e0171435", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "We have developed a novel analysis method that can interrogate the authenticity of biological samples used for generation of transcriptome profiles in public data repositories.

Cell lines constitute key model systems widely used within cancer research, but their identity needs to be confirmed in order to minimise the influence of cell contaminations and genetic drift on the analysis.

We successfully authenticate the studied cell lines and validate previous reports indicating that DLD1 and HCT15 are synonymous. We also show that the analysed HKE3 cells harbour an unexpected KRAS-G13D mutation and confirm that this cell line is a genuine KRAS dosage mutant, rather than a true isogenic derivative of HCT116 expressing only the wild type KRAS.

Our data demonstrate that miRNAs with an AAGUGC motif in their seed sequence increase both cancer cell proliferation and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Global transcriptomics, proteomics and target prediction resulted in the identification of several tumor suppressors involved in the G1/S transition as AAGUGC-miRNA targets.

In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2\u2009centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.", "doi": "10.1038/nature21039", "pmid": "28146470", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature21039"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5302847"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS834200"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e16b1a021a0e42aea2eb4a9ed9d95719.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e16b1a021a0e42aea2eb4a9ed9d95719"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "07f943c602224528812fe68f04e4fa03", "title": "Photochemically Induced Aryl Azide Rearrangement: Solution NMR Spectroscopic Identification of the Rearrangement Product", "authors": [{"family": "Andersson", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gr\u00e4fenstein", "given": "J\u00fcrgen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Isobe", "given": "Minoru", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Erd\u00e9lyi", "given": "M\u00e1t\u00e9", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sydnes", "given": "Magne O", "initials": "MO"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-02-03", "journal": {"volume": "82", "issn": "1520-6904", "issue": "3", "pages": "1812-1816", "title": "J.

However, we still lack knowledge on the physiological and functional responses by which ectotherms acclimate to temperatures during development, and in particular, how physiological stress at extreme temperatures may counteract beneficial acclimation responses at benign temperatures. We exposed Drosophila melanogaster to 10 developmental temperatures covering their entire permissible temperature range. We obtained metabolic profiles and reaction norms for several functional traits: egg-to-adult viability, developmental time, and heat and cold tolerance. Females were more heat tolerant than males, whereas no sexual dimorphism was found in cold tolerance. A group of metabolites, mainly free amino acids, had linear reaction norms. Several energy-carrying molecules, as well as some sugars, showed distinct inverted U-shaped norms of reaction across the thermal range, resulting in a positive correlation between metabolite intensities and egg-to-adult viability. At extreme temperatures, low levels of these metabolites were interpreted as a response characteristic of costs of homeostatic perturbations. Our results provide novel insights into a range of metabolites reported to be central for the acclimation response and suggest several new candidate metabolites. Low and high temperatures result in different adaptive physiological responses, but they also have commonalities likely to be a result of the failure to compensate for the physiological stress. We suggest that the regulation of metabolites that are tightly connected to the performance curve is important for the ability of ectotherms to cope with variation in temperature.", "doi": "10.1152/ajpregu.00268.2016", "pmid": "27927623", "labels": {"Swedish NMR Centre (SNC)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ajpregu.00268.2016"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5336569"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/852f20143a4546a9bbabf51403a46d9e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/852f20143a4546a9bbabf51403a46d9e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8647f49647c04b678c4e64e993003d70", "title": "Causal Effect of Genetic Variants Associated With Body Mass Index on Multiple Sclerosis Susceptibility.", "authors": [{"family": "Gianfrancesco", "given": "Milena A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Glymour", "given": "M Maria", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Walter", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rhead", "given": "Brooke", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Shao", "given": "Xiaorong", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Shen", "given": "Ling", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Quach", "given": "Hong", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Hubbard", "given": "Alan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir", "given": "Ingileif", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Stef\u00e1nsson", "given": "K\u00e1ri", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Strid", "given": "Pernilla", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hillert", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hedstr\u00f6m", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Olsson", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Kockum", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Schaefer", "given": "Catherine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Alfredsson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Barcellos", "given": "Lisa F", "initials": "LF"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-02-01", "journal": {"volume": "185", "issn": "1476-6256", "issue": "3", "pages": "162-171", "title": "Am.

Using data from non-Hispanic white members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan of Northern California (KPNC) (2006-2014; 1,104 cases of MS and 10,536 controls) and a replication data set from Sweden (the Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) and the Genes and Environment in MS (GEMS) studies, 2005-2013; 5,133 MS cases and 4,718 controls), we constructed a weighted genetic risk score using 97 variants previously established to predict BMI. Results were adjusted for birth year, sex, education, smoking status, ancestry, and genetic predictors of MS. Estimates in KPNC and Swedish data sets suggested that higher genetically induced BMI predicted greater susceptibility to MS (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.22 for the KPNC sample; odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.15 for the Swedish sample).

Prior to the onset of AN, premorbid body mass index (BMI) spans the entire range from underweight to obese. After recovery, patients have reduced rates of overweight and obesity. As such, loci involved in body weight regulation may also be relevant for AN and vice versa. Our primary analysis comprised a cross-trait analysis of the 1000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the lowest P-values in a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of AN (GCAN) for evidence of association in the largest published GWAMA for BMI (GIANT). Subsequently we performed sex-stratified analyses for these 1000 SNPs. Functional ex vivo studies on four genes ensued. Lastly, a look-up of GWAMA-derived BMI-related loci was performed in the AN GWAMA. We detected significant associations (P-values <5 \u00d7 10(-5), Bonferroni-corrected P<0.05) for nine SNP alleles at three independent loci. Interestingly, all AN susceptibility alleles were consistently associated with increased BMI. None of the genes (chr. 10: CTBP2, chr. 19: CCNE1, chr. 2: CARF and NBEAL1; the latter is a region with high linkage disequilibrium) nearest to these SNPs has previously been associated with AN or obesity. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the strongest BMI signal originated predominantly from females (chr. 10 rs1561589; Poverall: 2.47 \u00d7 10(-06)/Pfemales: 3.45 \u00d7 10(-07)/Pmales: 0.043). Functional ex vivo studies in mice revealed reduced hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 and Nbeal1 after fasting. Hypothalamic expression of Ctbp2 was increased in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice as compared with age-matched lean controls. We observed no evidence for associations for the look-up of BMI-related loci in the AN GWAMA.

A naturally occurring alternative splice event between zinc fingers three and four, removing or retaining three amino acids (\u00b1KTS), is believed to change the DNA binding affinity of WT1, although there are conflicting data regarding the binding affinity and motifs of the different isoforms. Increased expression of the WT1 -KTS isoform at the expense of the WT1 +KTS isoform is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined the genome-wide binding pattern of WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS in leukemic K562 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We discovered that the WT1 -KTS isoform predominantly binds close to transcription start sites and to enhancers, in a similar fashion to other transcription factors, whereas WT1 +KTS binding is enriched within gene bodies. We observed a significant overlap between WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes, despite the binding sites being distinct. Motif discovery revealed distinct binding motifs for the isoforms, some of which have been previously reported as WT1 binding sites. Additional analyses showed that both WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes are more likely to be transcribed than non-targets, and are involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and development. Our study provides evidence that WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS share target genes yet still bind distinct locations, indicating isoform-specific regulation in transcription of genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, consistent with the involvement of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia.", "doi": "10.3324/haematol.2016.149815", "pmid": "27612989", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "haematol.2016.149815"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5286941"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/179081d94ec4445399f3f2ddc36fac7e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/179081d94ec4445399f3f2ddc36fac7e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1acded0fd6a14542ab5ca0f60463b32b", "title": "A meta-analysis of reflux genome-wide association studies in 6750 Northern Europeans from the general population.", "authors": [{"family": "Bonfiglio", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hysi", "given": "P G", "initials": "PG"}, {"family": "Ek", "given": "W", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Karhunen", "given": "V", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Rivera", "given": "N V", "initials": "NV"}, {"family": "M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nordenstedt", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Zucchelli", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bresso", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Williams", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Tornblom", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "P K", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "N L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Ronkainen", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schmidt", "given": "P T", "initials": "PT"}, {"family": "D'Amato", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "29", "issn": "1365-2982", "issue": "2", "title": "Neurogastroenterol.

We distinguished 62 neuronal subtypes producing glutamatergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic markers for synaptic neurotransmission and harboring the ability to engage in task-dependent neurotransmitter switching. We identified dopamine neurons that uniquely coexpress the Onecut3 and Nmur2 genes, and placed these in the periventricular nucleus with many synaptic afferents arising from neuromedin S(+) neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These neuroendocrine dopamine cells may contribute to the dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin secretion diurnally, as their neuromedin S(+) inputs originate from neurons expressing Per2 and Per3 and their tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation is regulated in a circadian fashion.

Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12 (TRIP12) gene (OMIM 604506), which encodes an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin pathway, have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

The TRIP12 mutation-positive individuals presented with mild to moderate ID (10/11) or learning disability [intelligence quotient (IQ) 76 in one individual], ASD (8/11) and some of them with unspecific craniofacial dysmorphism and other anomalies. In this study, we provide detailed clinical information of 11 TRIP12 mutation-positive individuals and thereby expand the clinical spectrum of the TRIP12 gene in non-syndromic intellectual disability with or without ASD.", "doi": "10.1007/s00439-016-1743-x", "pmid": "27848077", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service", "Clinical Genomics Stockholm": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00439-016-1743-x"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b555f13298ec4a75b25a26825eb7af97.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b555f13298ec4a75b25a26825eb7af97"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c3d1ea2fcb184dfa8d3078a38811a2ce", "title": "Activation of myeloid and endothelial cells by CD40L gene therapy supports T-cell expansion and migration into the tumor microenvironment", "authors": [{"family": "Eriksson", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Moreno", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Milenova", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Liljenfeldt", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Dieterich", "given": "L C", "initials": "LC"}, {"family": "Christiansson", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Ullenhag", "given": "G", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mangsbo", "given": "S M", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Dimberg", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Alemany", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Loskog", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2017-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "0969-7128", "issue": "2", "pages": "92-103", "title": "Gene Ther"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/gt.2016.80", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c3d1ea2fcb184dfa8d3078a38811a2ce.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c3d1ea2fcb184dfa8d3078a38811a2ce"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c63ea0fe49dd453798aca844add7e849", "title": "The in silico identification and characterization of a bread wheat/Triticum militinae introgression line.", "authors": [{"family": "Abrouk", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Balc\u00e1rkov\u00e1", "given": "Barbora", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "\u0160imkov\u00e1", "given": "Hana", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Kom\u00ednkova", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Martis", "given": "Mihaela M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Jakobson", "given": "Irena", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Timofejeva", "given": "Ljudmilla", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rey", "given": "Elodie", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Vr\u00e1na", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kilian", "given": "Andrzej", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rve", "given": "Kadri", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dole\u017eel", "given": "Jaroslav", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Val\u00e1rik", "given": "Miroslav", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1467-7652", "issue": "2", "pages": "249-256", "title": "Plant Biotechnol.

A comparison between the native and introgressed forms of the 4AL chromosome arm showed that the introgressed region is located at the distal part of the arm.

We sought to investigate the associations of LDL cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 variants with type 2 diabetes and related biomarkers to gauge the likely effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on diabetes risk.\n\nIn this mendelian randomisation study, we used data from cohort studies, randomised controlled trials, case control studies, and genetic consortia to estimate associations of PCSK9 genetic variants with LDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, bodyweight, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, and risk of type 2 diabetes, using a standardised analysis plan, meta-analyses, and weighted gene-centric scores.\n\nData were available for more than 550\u2008000 individuals and 51\u2008623 cases of type 2 diabetes. Combined analyses of four independent PCSK9 variants (rs11583680, rs11591147, rs2479409, and rs11206510) scaled to 1 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol showed associations with increased fasting glucose (0\u00b709 mmol/L, 95% CI 0\u00b702 to 0\u00b715), bodyweight (1\u00b703 kg, 0\u00b724 to 1\u00b782), waist-to-hip ratio (0\u00b7006, 0\u00b7003 to 0\u00b7010), and an odds ratio for type diabetes of 1\u00b729 (1\u00b711 to 1\u00b750). Based on the collected data, we did not identify associations with HbA1c (0\u00b703%, -0\u00b701 to 0\u00b708), fasting insulin (0\u00b700%, -0\u00b706 to 0\u00b707), and BMI (0\u00b711 kg/m(2), -0\u00b709 to 0\u00b730).\n\nPCSK9 variants associated with lower LDL cholesterol were also associated with circulating higher fasting glucose concentration, bodyweight, and waist-to-hip ratio, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

The cyanobacterial community constituted close to 12% of the microbial population sampled during a pre-bloom period (June-July 2009). The community was dominated by unicellular picocyanobacteria, specifically a few highly abundant taxa (Synechococcus and Cyanobium) with a long tail of low abundance representatives, and local peaks of bloom-forming heterocystous taxa. Cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea differed genetically from those in adjacent limnic and marine waters as well as from cultivated and sequenced picocyanobacterial strains. Diversity peaked at brackish salinities 3.5-16\u00a0psu, with low N:P ratios. A shift in community composition from brackish to marine strains was accompanied by a change in the repertoire and expression of genes involved in salt acclimation.

Prodynorphin (PDYN) is the precursor protein to dynorphins, endogenous ligands for the \u03ba-opioid receptor. Alternative mRNA splicing of neuropeptide genes may regulate cell- and tissue-specific neuropeptide expression and produce novel protein isoforms. We here searched for novel PDYN mRNA and their protein product in the human brain.\n\nNovel PDYN transcripts were identified using nested PCR amplification of oligo(dT) selected full-length capped mRNA. Gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR, PDYN protein by western blotting and confocal imaging, dynorphin peptides by radioimmunoassay. Neuronal nuclei were isolated using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) from postmortem human striatal tissue. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy was performed for human caudate nucleus.\n\nTwo novel human PDYN mRNA splicing variants were identified. Expression of one of them was confined to the striatum where its levels constituted up to 30% of total PDYN mRNA. This transcript may be translated into \u2206SP-PDYN protein lacking 13 N-terminal amino acids, a fragment of signal peptide (SP). \u2206SP-PDYN was not processed to mature dynorphins and surprisingly, was targeted to the cell nuclei in a model cellular system.

Recent observations indicate that vimentin is not only a passive marker for carcinoma, but may also induce tumor cell invasion. To clarify how vimentin IFs control cell adhesions and migration, we analyzed the nanoscale (30\u201350 nm) spatial organization of vimentin IFs and cell-matrix adhesions in metastatic fibroblast cells, using three-color stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. We also studied whether wild-type and phospho-deficient or -mimicking mutants of vimentin changed the size and lifetime of focal adhesions (FAs), cell shape, and cell migration, using live-cell total internal reflection imaging and confocal microscopy. We observed that vimentin exists in fragments of different lengths. Short fragments were mostly the size of a unit-length filament and were mainly localized close to small cell-matrix adhesions. Long vimentin filaments were found in the proximity of large FAs. Vimentin expression in these cells caused a reduction in FAs size and an elongated cell shape, but did not affect FA lifetime, or the speed or directionality of cell migration. Expression of a phospho-mimicking mutant (S71D) of vimentin increased the speed of cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that in highly migratory, transformed mesenchymal cells, vimentin levels control the cell shape and FA size, but not cell migration, which instead is linked to the phosphorylation status of S71 vimentin. These observations are consistent with the possibility that not only levels, but also the assembly status of vimentin control cell migration.", "doi": "10.3390/cells6010002", "pmid": null, "labels":

integrally involved in episodic memory, spatial navigation, cognition and stress responsiveness. Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200\u2009kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155).

Variations in vascular characteristics are likely to contribute to variations in intrinsic aggressiveness of the disease. Emerging studies are identifying perivascular status, including perivascular PDGFR-\u03b2, as a determinant of prognosis in other tumour types.\n\nThis work explored the impact on prognosis of vascular characteristics in RCC through analyses of a population-based collection of tumours from surgery-alone-treated patients. The quantitative data from a panel of vascular metrics were obtained through computerised image analysis of sections double-stained for expression of the endothelial cell marker CD34 together with perivascular markers \u03b1-SMA or PDGFR-\u03b2.\n\nPerivascular expression of PDGFR-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA were positively correlated to each other, and negatively correlated to vessel density. High expression of PDGFR-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA as well as low vessel density was significantly associated with short survival in uni- and multivariate analyses. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the prognostic impact of the perivascular markers was particularly prominent in the T4-subgroup. A novel metric, related to PDGFR-\u03b2 perivascular heterogeneity, was also associated with prognosis in uni-and multi-variate analyses. This novel metric also acted as a prognosis marker in ovarian cancer.\n\nThe study demonstrates previously unrecognised associations between RCC survival and the absolute levels, and variability, of perivascular PDGFR-\u03b2. This marker should be further explored in other RCC cohorts.

Increasing body of evidence suggests a complex connection of SNPs and the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which is poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the interplay between genetic risk variants, shifts in methylation and mRNA levels in whole blood from 223 adolescents distinguished by a risk for developing psychiatric disorders. We analyzed 37 SNPs previously associated with psychiatric diseases in relation to genome-wide DNA methylation levels using linear models, with Bonferroni correction and adjusting for cell-type composition. Associations between DNA methylation, mRNA levels and psychiatric disease risk evaluated by the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) score were identified by robust linear models, Pearson's correlations and binary regression models. We detected five SNPs (in HCRTR1, GAD1, HADC3 and FKBP5) that were associated with eight CpG sites, validating five of these SNP-CpG pairs. Three of these CpG sites, that is, cg01089319 (GAD1), cg01089249 (GAD1) and cg24137543 (DIAPH1), manifest in significant gene expression changes and overlap with active regulatory regions in chromatin states of brain tissues. Importantly, methylation levels at cg01089319 were associated with the DAWBA score in the discovery group.

Starting from planar protein arrays with 3786 protein fragments to screen 80 patients with and without PCA diagnosis, 161 fragments (4%) were chosen for further analysis based on their reactivity profiles. Adding 71 antigens from literature, the selection of antigens was corroborated for their reactivity in a set of 550 samples using suspension bead arrays. The antigens prostein (SLC45A3), TATA-box binding protein (TBP), and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) showed higher reactivity in PCA patients with late disease compared with early disease. Because of its prostate tissue specificity, we focused on prostein and continued with mapping epitopes of the 66-mer protein fragment using patient samples. Using bead-based assays and 15-mer peptides, a minimal peptide epitope was identified and refined by alanine scanning to the KPxAPFP. Further sequence alignment of this motif revealed homology to transmembrane protein 79 (TMEM79) and TGF-beta-induced factor 2 (TGIF2), thus providing a reasoning for cross-reactivity found in females.

Today, the high- and low-weight lines show a >12-fold difference for the selected trait, 56-d body weight. These lines provide unique opportunities to study the genetic architecture of long-term, single-trait selection. Previously, several quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to weight differences between the lines were mapped in an F2-cross between them, and these were later replicated and fine-mapped in a nine-generation advanced intercross of them. Here, we explore the possibility to further increase the fine-mapping resolution of these QTL via a pedigree-based imputation strategy that aims to better capture the genetic diversity in the divergently selected, but outbred, founder lines. The founders of the intercross were high-density genotyped, and then pedigree-based imputation was used to assign genotypes throughout the pedigree. Imputation increased the marker density 20-fold in the selected QTL, providing 6911 markers for the subsequent analysis.

Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis of long term adaptation to acidic environments will be beneficial for engineering production strains to thrive under such harsh conditions. Previous studies using gene expression analysis have suggested that both organic and inorganic acids display similar responses during short term exposure to acidic conditions. However, biological mechanisms that will lead to long term adaptation of yeast to acidic conditions remains unknown and whether these mechanisms will be similar for tolerance to both organic and inorganic acids is yet to be explored. We therefore evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae to acquire tolerance to HCl (inorganic acid) and to 0.3M L-lactic acid (organic acid) at pH 2.8 and then isolated several low pH tolerant strains. Whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis of the evolved strains revealed different sets of genome alterations suggesting a divergence in adaptation to these two acids. An altered sterol composition and impaired iron uptake contributed to HCl tolerance whereas the formation of a multicellular morphology and rapid lactate degradation was crucial for tolerance to high concentrations of lactic acid. Our findings highlight the contribution of both the selection pressure and nature of the acid as a driver for directing the evolutionary path towards tolerance to low pH. The choice of carbon source was also an important factor in the evolutionary process since cells evolved on two different carbon sources (raffinose and glucose) generated a different set of mutations in response to the presence of lactic acid. Therefore, different strategies are required for a rational design of low pH tolerant strains depending on the acid of interest.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ymben.2016.10.010", "pmid": "27815194", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service", "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1096-7176(16)30175-6"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15650b102c574ba3b445c90eef4e6c11.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15650b102c574ba3b445c90eef4e6c11"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "32c370e02d384d7e896285e4a06530ad", "title": "Both maternal and offspring Elovl2 genotypes determine systemic DHA levels in perinatal mice.", "authors": [{"family": "Pauter", "given": "Anna M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Trattner", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gonzalez-Bengtsson", "given": "Amanda", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Talamonti", "given": "Emanuela", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Asadi", "given": "Abolfazl", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dethlefsen", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Jacobsson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "58", "issn": "1539-7262", "issue": "1", "pages": "111-123", "title": "J.

The PUFA elongase, elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL)2, is a critical enzyme in the formation of DHA in mammals. In order to address the question regarding the origin of DHA during perinatal life, we have used DHA-deficient Elovl2-ablated mice as a model system to analyze the maternal impact on the DHA level in their offspring of various genotypes. Elovl2(-/-) mothers maintained on control diet had significantly lower systemic levels of DHA compared with the Elovl2(+/-) and Elovl2(+/+) mothers. Dietary DHA administration during the pregnancy and lactation periods led to increased DHA accretion in maternal tissues and serum of all genotypes. The proportion of DHA in the liver and serum of the Elovl2(-/-) offspring was significantly lower than in the Elovl2(+/+) offspring. Remarkably, the DHA level in the Elovl2(+/-) offspring nursed by DHA-free-fed Elovl2(-/-) mothers was almost as high as in +/+ pups delivered by +/+ mothers, suggesting that endogenous synthesis in the offspring can compensate for maternal DHA deficiency. Maternal DHA supplementation had a strong impact on offspring hepatic gene expression, especially of the fatty acid transporter, Mfsd2a, suggesting a dynamic interplay between DHA synthesis and DHA uptake in the control of systemic levels in the offspring.", "doi": "10.1194/jlr.M070862", "pmid": "27864326", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "jlr.M070862"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC5234714"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/32c370e02d384d7e896285e4a06530ad.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/32c370e02d384d7e896285e4a06530ad"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "33bd1e90ae2942cfb7f394e25b50819d", "title": "Association of Body Mass Index with DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Blood Cells and Relations to Cardiometabolic Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Approach.", "authors": [{"family": "Mendelson", "given": "Michael M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Marioni", "given": "Riccardo E", "initials": "RE"}, {"family": "Joehanes", "given": "Roby", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Chunyu", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hedman", "given": "\u00c5sa K", "initials": "\u00c5K"}, {"family": "Aslibekyan", "given": "Stella", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Demerath", "given": "Ellen W", "initials": "EW"}, {"family": "Guan", "given": "Weihua", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Zhi", "given": "Degui", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Yao", "given": "Chen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Huan", "given": "Tianxiao", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Willinger", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Brian", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Courchesne", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Multhaup", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Irvin", "given": "Marguerite R", "initials": "MR"}, {"family": "Cohain", "given": "Ariella", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schadt", "given": "Eric E", "initials": "EE"}, {"family": "Grove", "given": "Megan L", "initials": "ML"}, {"family": "Bressler", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "North", "given": "Kari", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Gustafsson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Shah", "given": "Sonia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "McRae", "given": "Allan F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Harris", "given": "Sarah E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Gibson", "given": "Jude", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Redmond", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Corley", "given": "Janie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Murphy", "given": "Lee", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Starr", "given": "John M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Kleinbrink", "given": "Erica", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lipovich", "given": "Leonard", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Visscher", "given": "Peter M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "Wray", "given": "Naomi R", "initials": "NR"}, {"family": "Krauss", "given": "Ronald M", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Fallin", "given": "Daniele", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Feinberg", "given": "Andrew", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Absher", "given": "Devin M", "initials": "DM"}, {"family": "Fornage", "given": "Myriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pankow", "given": "James S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Lind", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Fox", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ingelsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Arnett", "given": "Donna K", "initials": "DK"}, {"family": "Boerwinkle", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Liang", "given": "Liming", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Levy", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Deary", "given": "Ian J", "initials": "IJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1549-1676", "issue": "1", "pages": "e1002215", "title": "PLoS Med."}, "abstract": "The link between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases in the general population remains uncertain.\n\nWe conducted an association study of body mass index (BMI) and differential methylation for over 400,000 CpGs assayed by microarray in whole-blood-derived DNA from 3,743 participants in the Framingham Heart Study and the Lothian Birth Cohorts, with independent replication in three external cohorts of 4,055 participants.

In total, 1954 and 1218 B-derived transcripts with an open reading frame were expressed in generative and vegetative tissues, respectively. In addition to B-derived transposable element transcripts, a high percentage of short transcripts without detectable similarity to known proteins and gene fragments from A chromosomes (As) were found, suggesting an ongoing gene erosion process. In\u00a0vitro analysis of the A- and B-encoded AGO4B protein variants demonstrated that both possess RNA slicer activity. These data demonstrate unambiguously the presence of a functional AGO4B gene on Bs and that these Bs carry both functional protein coding genes and pseudogene copies.

Genetic studies, radiocarbon dating, and taphonomic analyses were used to examine two grave clusters from Krusza Zamkowa, Poland. To reconstruct kinship and determine biological sex, we extracted DNA from bones and teeth, analyzed mitochondrial genomes and nuclear SNPs using the HID-Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Identity panel generated on Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms, respectively. We further dated the material (AMS (14)C) and to exclude aquatic radiocarbon reservoir effects, measures of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes for diet reconstruction were used. We found distinct mitochondrial genomes belonging to haplogroups U5b2a1a, K1c and H3d in the first grave cluster, and excluded maternal kin patterns among the three analyzed individuals. In the second grave cluster one individual belonged to K1a4. However, we could not affiliate the second individual to a certain haplogroup due to the fragmented state of the mitochondrial genome. Although the individuals from the second grave cluster differ at position 6643, we believe that more data is needed to fully resolve this issue. We retrieved between 26 and 77 autosomal SNPs from three of the individuals. Based on kinship estimations, taking into account the allelic dropout distribution, we could not exclude first degree kin relation between the two individuals from the second grave cluster. We could, however, exclude a first degree kinship between these two individuals and an individual from the first grave cluster. Presumably, not only biological kinship, but also social relations played an important role in the funerary practice during this time period. We further conclude that the HID-Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Identity Panel may prove useful for first degree kin relation studies for samples with good DNA preservation, and that mitochondrial genome capture enrichment is a powerful tool for excluding direct maternal relationship in ancient individuals.", "doi": "10.1016/j.fsigen.2016.10.008", "pmid": "27771467", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service", "Bioinformatics Compute and Storage": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1872-4973(16)30193-4"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/86fb99b8bde44d8782114a6a0c9fbafe.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/86fb99b8bde44d8782114a6a0c9fbafe"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8a6fa76781b74bb8b0b580e3693aa9cc", "title": "Identification of two distinct mesenchymal stromal cell populations in human malignant glioma.", "authors": [{"family": "Svensson", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ramos-Moreno", "given": "Tania", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Eberst\u00e5l", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Scheding", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bengzon", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2017-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "131", "issn": "1573-7373", "issue": "2", "pages": "245-254", "title": "J.

We found that MSC-like cells can be isolated from primary human malignant gliomas. Two distinct MSC-like cell populations, differing in their expression of the CD90 surface marker, were discovered after cell sorting. RNA sequencing revealed further genetic differences between these two cell populations and MSC-like cells lacking CD90 produced higher amounts of VEGF and PGE2 compared to cells with the true MSC phenotype, implying that the CD90(-) MSC-like cells most probably are more active in tumor vascularization and immunosuppression than their CD90(+) counterpart.

This approach averages the estimated effects of genetic variants across studies. In case genetic effects are heterogeneous across studies, the statistical power of a GWAS and the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores are attenuated, contributing to the so-called 'missing heritability'. Here, we describe the online Meta-GWAS Accuracy and Power (MetaGAP) calculator (available at www.devlaming.eu) which quantifies this attenuation based on a novel multi-study framework. By means of simulation studies, we show that under a wide range of genetic architectures, the statistical power and predictive accuracy provided by this calculator are accurate. We compare the predictions from the MetaGAP calculator with actual results obtained in the GWAS literature. Specifically, we use genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the SNP heritability and cross-study genetic correlation of height, BMI, years of education, and self-rated health in three large samples. These estimates are used as input parameters for the MetaGAP calculator. Results from the calculator suggest that cross-study heterogeneity has led to attenuation of statistical power and predictive accuracy in recent large-scale GWAS efforts on these traits (e.g., for years of education, we estimate a relative loss of 51-62% in the number of genome-wide significant loci and a relative loss in polygenic score R2 of 36-38%).
