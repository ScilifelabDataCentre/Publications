The assignment of a functional role for the identified disease-associated SNP is not straight-forward. Genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is frequently used as the initial step to define a function while allele-specific gene expression (ASE) analysis has not yet gained a wide-spread use in disease mapping studies. We compared the power to identify cis-acting regulatory SNPs (cis-rSNPs) by genome-wide allele-specific gene expression (ASE) analysis with that of traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. Our study included 395 healthy blood donors for whom global gene expression profiles in circulating monocytes were determined by Illumina BeadArrays. ASE was assessed in a subset of these monocytes from 188 donors by quantitative genotyping of mRNA using a genome-wide panel of SNP markers. The performance of the two methods for detecting cis-rSNPs was evaluated by comparing associations between SNP genotypes and gene expression levels in sample sets of varying size. We found that up to 8-fold more samples are required for eQTL mapping to reach the same statistical power as that obtained by ASE analysis for the same rSNPs. The performance of ASE is insensitive to SNPs with low minor allele frequencies and detects a larger number of significantly associated rSNPs using the same sample size as eQTL mapping. An unequivocal conclusion from our comparison is that ASE analysis is more sensitive for detecting cis-rSNPs than standard eQTL mapping. Our study shows the potential of ASE mapping in tissue samples and primary cells which are difficult to obtain in large numbers.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0052260", "pmid": "23300628", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-18082"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3530574"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/57d11cb6d6af42fa9a9b497a2b9d67da.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/57d11cb6d6af42fa9a9b497a2b9d67da"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "93db6ff10b0f4ed48c3a43f6b7d7a551", "title": "Genomic diversity of the 2011 European outbreaks of Escherichia coli O104:H4.", "authors": [{"family": "Guy", "given": "Lionel", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Jernberg", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ivarsson", "given": "Sofie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hedenstr\u00f6m", "given": "Ingela", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Engstrand", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Siv G E", "initials": "SG"}], "type": "comment", "published": "2012-12-26", "journal": {"volume": "109", "issn": "1091-6490", "issue": "52", "pages": "E3627-E3628", "title": "Proc.

To discover novel associations with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, we developed a strategy for integrating prior biological knowledge into the existing GWAS data for eGFR from the CKDGen Consortium. Our strategy focuses on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in genes that are connected by functional evidence, determined by literature mining and gene ontology (GO) hierarchies, to genes near previously validated eGFR associations. It then requires association thresholds consistent with multiple testing, and finally evaluates novel candidates by independent replication. Among the samples of European ancestry, we identified a genome-wide significant SNP in FBXL20 (P = 5.6 \u00d7 10(-9)) in meta-analysis of all available data, and additional SNPs at the INHBC, LRP2, PLEKHA1, SLC3A2 and SLC7A6 genes meeting multiple-testing corrected significance for replication and overall P-values of 4.5 \u00d7 10(-4)-2.2 \u00d7 10(-7). Neither the novel PLEKHA1 nor FBXL20 associations, both further supported by association with eGFR among African Americans and with transcript abundance, would have been implicated by eGFR candidate gene approaches. LRP2, encoding the megalin receptor, was identified through connection with the previously known eGFR gene DAB2 and extends understanding of the megalin system in kidney function. These findings highlight integration of existing genome-wide association data with independent biological knowledge to uncover novel candidate eGFR associations, including candidates lacking known connections to kidney-specific pathways.

There is presently an intense research focus on the role(s) of effectors in promoting late blight disease development. However, little is known about how they are regulated, or how diversity in their expression may be generated among different isolates. Here we present data from investigation of RNA silencing processes, characterized by non-coding small RNA molecules (sRNA) of 19-40 nt. From deep sequencing of sRNAs we have identified sRNAs matching numerous RxLR and Crinkler (CRN) effector protein genes in two isolates differing in pathogenicity. Effector gene-derived sRNAs were present in both isolates, but exhibited marked differences in abundance, especially for CRN effectors. Small RNAs in P. infestans grouped into three clear size classes of 21, 25/26 and 32 nt. Small RNAs from all size classes mapped to RxLR effector genes, but notably 21 nt sRNAs were the predominant size class mapping to CRN effector genes. Some effector genes, such as PiAvr3a, to which sRNAs were found, also exhibited differences in transcript accumulation between the two isolates. The P. infestans genome is rich in transposable elements, and the majority of sRNAs of all size classes mapped to these sequences, predominantly to long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. RNA silencing of Dicer and Argonaute genes provided evidence that generation of 21 nt sRNAs is Dicer-dependent, while accumulation of longer sRNAs was impacted by silencing of Argonaute genes.

We recently reported differential DNA methylation profiles in IGHV-mutated and IGHV-unmutated CLL subgroups. For the first time, we here explore the global methylation profiles of stereotyped subsets with different prognosis, by applying high-resolution methylation arrays on CLL samples from three major stereotyped subsets: the poor-prognostic subsets #1 (n = 15) and #2 (n = 9) and the favorable-prognostic subset #4 (n = 15). Overall, the three subsets exhibited significantly different methylation profiles, which only partially overlapped with those observed in our previous study according to IGHV gene mutational status. Specifically, gene ontology analysis of the differentially methylated genes revealed a clear enrichment of genes involved in immune response, such as B cell activation (e.g., CD80, CD86 and IL10), with higher methylation levels in subset #1 than subsets #2 and #4. Accordingly, higher expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was demonstrated in subset #4 vs. subset #1, pointing to a key role for these molecules in the crosstalk of CLL subset #4 cells with the microenvironment. In summary, investigation of three prototypic, stereotyped CLL subsets revealed distinct DNA methylation profiles for each subset, which suggests subset-biased patterns of transcriptional control and highlights a key role for epigenetics during leukemogenesis.", "doi": "10.4161/epi.22901", "pmid": "23154584", "labels": {"Array and Analysis Facility": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "22901"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3528698"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b5717e1da4704310b8977f7958d2bf33.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b5717e1da4704310b8977f7958d2bf33"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "441062b272f84356bccf64bd2640e953", "title": "Genome sequence of Francisella tularensis subspecies holarctica strain FSC200, isolated from a child with tularemia.", "authors": [{"family": "Svensson", "given": "Kerstin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6din", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bystr\u00f6m", "given": "Mona", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Granberg", "given": "Malin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Brittnacher", "given": "Mitchell J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Rohmer", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Jacobs", "given": "Michael A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Sims-Day", "given": "Elizabeth H", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "Levy", "given": "Ruth", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Yang", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Hayden", "given": "Hillary S", "initials": "HS"}, {"family": "Lim", "given": "Regina", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Chang", "given": "Jean", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Guenthener", "given": "Donald", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Kang", "given": "Allison", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Haugen", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Gillett", "given": "Will", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Kaul", "given": "Rajinder", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Forsman", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "P\u00e4r", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "194", "issn": "1098-5530", "issue": "24", "pages": "6965-6966", "title": "J.

Ideally, the epitope(s) targeted by an antibody should be identified and characterized, thereby establishing antibody reactivity, highlighting possible cross-reactivities, and perhaps even warning against unwanted (e.g. autoimmune) reactivities. Antibodies target proteins as either conformational or linear epitopes. The latter are typically probed with peptides, but the cost of peptide screening programs tends to prohibit comprehensive specificity analysis. To perform high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of linear antibody epitopes, we have used ultrahigh-density peptide microarrays generating several hundred thousand different peptides per array. Using exhaustive length and substitution analysis, we have successfully examined the specificity of a panel of polyclonal antibodies raised against linear epitopes of the human proteome and obtained very detailed descriptions of the involved specificities. The epitopes identified ranged from 4 to 12 amino acids in size. In general, the antibodies were of exquisite specificity, frequently disallowing even single conservative substitutions. In several cases, multiple distinct epitopes could be identified for the same target protein, suggesting an efficient approach to the generation of paired antibodies. Two alternative epitope mapping approaches identified similar, although not necessarily identical, epitopes. These results show that ultrahigh-density peptide microarrays can be used for linear epitope mapping. With an upper theoretical limit of 2,000,000 individual peptides per array, these peptide microarrays may even be used for a systematic validation of antibodies at the proteomic level.", "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M112.020800", "pmid": "22984286", "labels": {"Autoimmunity Profiling": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M112.020800"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3518105"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/504f7661fda94a749fe7d389d0bb14fe.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/504f7661fda94a749fe7d389d0bb14fe"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "62c4803c14d84c888b82c4e4204c5014", "title": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and age at onset of schizophrenia: no consistent evidence for an association in the Nordic population.", "authors": [{"family": "Saetre", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Grove", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "B\u00f8rglum", "given": "Anders D", "initials": "AD"}, {"family": "Mors", "given": "Ole", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Werge", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Andreassen", "given": "Ole A", "initials": "OA"}, {"family": "Vares", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Agartz", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Terenius", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "J\u00f6nsson", "given": "Erik G", "initials": "EG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "159B", "issn": "1552-485X", "issue": "8", "pages": "981-986", "title": "Am.

Our method allows for quantitative comparisons of microtubule distribution parameters (number of microtubules, mean length) between different cell lines. Among eleven cell lines compared, some showed differences that could be accounted for by differences in the total amount of tubulin per cell while others showed statistically significant differences in the balance between number and length of microtubules.

Here we have used whole-genome resequencing to reveal some of the loci that underlie phenotypic evolution in European domestic pigs. Selective sweep analyses revealed strong signatures of selection at three loci harboring quantitative trait loci that explain a considerable part of one of the most characteristic morphological changes in the domestic pig--the elongation of the back and an increased number of vertebrae. The three loci were associated with the NR6A1, PLAG1, and LCORL genes. The latter two have repeatedly been associated with loci controlling stature in other domestic animals and in humans. Most European domestic pigs are homozygous for the same haplotype at these three loci. We found an excess of derived nonsynonymous substitutions in domestic pigs, most likely reflecting both positive selection and relaxed purifying selection after domestication. Our analysis of structural variation revealed four duplications at the KIT locus that were exclusively present in white or white-spotted pigs, carrying the Dominant white, Patch, or Belt alleles. This discovery illustrates how structural changes have contributed to rapid phenotypic evolution in domestic animals and how alleles in domestic animals may evolve by the accumulation of multiple causative mutations as a response to strong directional selection.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1217149109", "pmid": "23151514", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1217149109"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3511700"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3e2a7ef25d704e5587e03e2786f4d552.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3e2a7ef25d704e5587e03e2786f4d552"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d65fa716349a4deb8347441de3b6d573", "title": "Sequence based analysis of U-2973, a cell line established from a double-hit B-cell lymphoma with concurrent MYC and BCL2 rearrangements.", "authors": [{"family": "Hooper", "given": "Sean D", "initials": "SD"}, {"family": "Jiao", "given": "Xiang", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Elisabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rehman", "given": "Farah L", "initials": "FL"}, {"family": "Tellgren-Roth", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6blom", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Cavelier", "given": "Lucia", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-11-22", "journal": {"volume": "5", "issn": "1756-0500", "issue": null, "pages": "648", "title": "BMC Res Notes"}, "abstract": "Double-hit lymphoma is a complex and highly aggressive sub-type of B-cell lymphoma, which has recently been classified and is an area of active research interest due to the poor prognosis for patients with this disease.

Here, we present a cost-effective genome-wide study in a species that lacks a genome sequence. We first assembled a muscle transcriptome and then aligned genomic reads to the transcripts, creating an \"exome assembly,\" capturing both exons and flanking sequences. We then resequenced pools of fish from a wide geographic range, including the Northeast Atlantic, as well as different regions in the Baltic Sea, aligned the reads to the exome assembly, and identified 440,817 SNPs. The great majority of SNPs showed no appreciable differences in allele frequency among populations; however, several thousand SNPs showed striking differences, some approaching fixation for different alleles. The contrast between low genetic differentiation at most loci and striking differences at others implies that the latter category primarily reflects natural selection.

Despite a conserved 'Rossmann-fold' structure, members of the SDR superfamily exhibit low sequence similarities, which constituted a bottleneck in terms of identification. Recent classification methods, relying on hidden-Markov models (HMMs), improved identification and enabled the construction of a nomenclature. However, functional annotations of plant SDRs remain scarce.\n\nWide-scale analyses were performed on ten plant genomes. The combination of hidden Markov model (HMM) based analyses and similarity searches led to the construction of an exhaustive inventory of plant SDR. With 68 to 315 members found in each analysed genome, the inventory confirmed the over-representation of SDRs in plants compared to animals, fungi and prokaryotes. The plant SDRs were first classified into three major types - 'classical', 'extended' and 'divergent' - but a minority (10% of the predicted SDRs) could not be classified into these general types ('unknown' or 'atypical' types). In a second step, we could categorize the vast majority of land plant SDRs into a set of 49 families. Out of these 49 families, 35 appeared early during evolution since they are commonly found through all the Green Lineage. Yet, some SDR families - tropinone reductase-like proteins (SDR65C), 'ABA2-like'-NAD dehydrogenase (SDR110C), 'salutaridine/menthone-reductase-like' proteins (SDR114C), 'dihydroflavonol 4-reductase'-like proteins (SDR108E) and 'isoflavone-reductase-like' (SDR460A) proteins - have undergone significant functional diversification within vascular plants since they diverged from Bryophytes. Interestingly, these diversified families are either involved in the secondary metabolism routes (terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics) or participate in developmental processes (hormone biosynthesis or catabolism, flower development), in opposition to SDR families involved in primary metabolism which are poorly diversified.\n\nThe application of HMMs to plant genomes enabled us to identify 49 families that encompass all Angiosperms ('higher plants') SDRs, each family being sufficiently conserved to enable simpler analyses based only on overall sequence similarity. The multiplicity of SDRs in plant kingdom is mainly explained by the diversification of large families involved in different secondary metabolism pathways, suggesting that the chemical diversification that accompanied the emergence of vascular plants acted as a driving force for SDR evolution.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2229-12-219", "pmid": "23167570", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1471-2229-12-219"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3541173"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a2e31bb0de974a24a0767b2b43be5e9e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a2e31bb0de974a24a0767b2b43be5e9e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b8b2b87a0e29439e8aae7eae42a564ba", "title": "Polymorphisms in peptidylarginine deiminase associate with rheumatoid arthritis in diverse Asian populations: evidence from MyEIRA study and meta-analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Too", "given": "Chun Lai", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Murad", "given": "Shahnaz", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Dhaliwal", "given": "Jasbir Singh", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Jiang", "given": "Xia", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Ding", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Alfredsson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Klareskog", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Padyukov", "given": "Leonid", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-11-19", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1478-6362", "issue": "6", "pages": "R250", "title": "Arthritis Res.

The corresponding antibodies were applied on tissue microarrays, including 190 NSCLC samples, and stromal staining was correlated with clinical parameters.

The association was independent from the proportion of tumour stroma, the fraction of inflammatory cells and clinical and pathological parameters like stage, performance status and tumour histology. The prognostic impact of stromal CD99 protein expression was confirmed in an independent cohort of 240 NSCLC patients (p = 0.008).

The map resolution was improved by adding 146 sequence-tagged microsatellite markers and 39 sequenced gene markers. The new markers confirmed the positions of the anchored AFLP markers, fused the original 39 linkage groups together into 17, and fully expanded 12 of these to single groups covering entire chromosomes.

The anchored map also improved the H. irregulare assembly considerably.

This denser, more comprehensive map allowed sequence-based mapping of three intersterility loci and one mating type locus.

With the development of next generation sequencing, a single experiment can now simultaneously identify the transcribed part of a species genome and estimate levels of gene expression.\n\nmRNA from actively growing needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) was sequenced using next generation sequencing technology. In total, close to 70 million fragments with a length of 76 bp were sequenced resulting in 5 Gbp of raw data. A de novo assembly of these reads, together with publicly available expressed sequence tag (EST) data from Norway spruce, was used to create a reference transcriptome. Of the 38,419 PUTs (putative unique transcripts) longer than 150 bp in this reference assembly, 83.5% show similarity to ESTs from other spruce species and of the remaining PUTs, 3,704 show similarity to protein sequences from other plant species, leaving 4,167 PUTs with limited similarity to currently available plant proteins. By predicting coding frames and comparing not only the Norway spruce PUTs, but also PUTs from the close relatives Picea glauca and Picea sitchensis to both Pinus taeda and Taxus mairei, we obtained estimates of synonymous and non-synonymous divergence among conifer species. In addition, we detected close to 15,000 SNPs of high quality and estimated gene expression differences between samples collected under dark and light conditions.\n\nOur study yielded a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as estimates of gene expression on transcriptome scale.

A hierarchy of T-cell activation by MHC class I-restricted altered peptide ligands has been defined using the T-cell receptor P14 specific for H-2D(b) in complex with the immunodominant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus peptide gp33 (KAVYNFATM). While substitution of tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y4F) or serine (Y4S) abolished recognition by P14, the TCR unexpectedly recognized H-2D(b) in complex with the alanine-substituted semiagonist Y4A, which displayed the most significant structural modification. The observed functional hierarchy gp33 > Y4A > Y4S = Y4F was neither due to higher stabilization capacity nor to differences in structural conformation. However, thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that while recognition of the full agonist H-2D(b) /gp33 was strictly enthalpy driven, recognition of the weak agonist H-2D(b) /Y4A was instead entropy driven with a large reduction in the favorable enthalpy term. The fourfold larger negative heat capacity derived for the interaction of P14 with H-2D(b) /gp33 compared with H-2D(b) /Y4A can possibly be explained by higher water entrapment at the TCR/MHC interface, which is also consistent with the measured opposite entropy contributions for the interactions of P14 with both MHCs. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that P14 makes use of different strategies to adapt to structural modifications in the MHC/peptide complex.", "doi": "10.1002/eji.201242588", "pmid": "22837158", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d86c053b36a54fceb70a026f62cd1db1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d86c053b36a54fceb70a026f62cd1db1"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ae5c0309da6941ea817f0078274cff36", "title": "Human cord blood derived immature basophils show dual characteristics, expressing both basophil and eosinophil associated proteins.", "authors": [{"family": "Grundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jeanette", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Reimer", "given": "Jenny M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Sofia E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Gunnar", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Wernersson", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hellman", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-10-31", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "10", "pages": "e48308", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Basophils are blood cells of low abundance associated with allergy, inflammation and parasite infections. To study the transcriptome of mature circulating basophils cells were purified from buffy coats by density gradient centrifugations and two-step magnetic cell sorting. However, after extensive analysis the cells were found to be transcriptionally inactive and almost completely lack functional mRNA. In order to obtain transcriptionally active immature basophils for analysis of their transcriptome, umbilical cord blood cells were therefore cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3 for 9 days and basophils were enriched by removing non-basophils using magnetic cell sorting. The majority of purified cells demonstrated typical metachromatic staining with Alcian blue dye (95%) and expression of surface markers Fc\u03b5RI and CD203c, indicating a pure population of cells with basophil-like phenotype. mRNA was extracted from these cells and used to construct a cDNA library with approximately 600 000 independent clones. This library served as tool to determine the mRNA frequencies for a number of hematopoietic marker proteins. It was shown that these cells express basophil/mast cell-specific transcripts, i.e. \u03b2-tryptase, serglycin and Fc\u03b5RI \u03b1-chain, to a relatively low degree. In contrast, the library contained a high number of several eosinophil-associated transcripts such as: major basic protein (MBP), charcot leyden crystal (CLC), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). Out of these transcripts, MBP and EPO were the most frequently observed, representing 8% and 3.2% of the total mRNA pool, respectively. Moreover, in a proteome analysis of cultured basophils we identified MBP and EPO as the two most prominent protein bands, suggesting a good correlation between protein and mRNA analyses of these cells. The mixed phenotype observed for these cells strengthens the conclusion that eosinophils and basophils are closely linked during human hematopoietic development. The dual phenotype also indicates that other cytokines than IL-3 or cell surface interactions are needed to obtain the full basophil specific phenotype in vivo.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0048308", "pmid": "23118978", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-19859"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3485157"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ae5c0309da6941ea817f0078274cff36.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ae5c0309da6941ea817f0078274cff36"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4ac7c51a01b2483582546addacfcc239", "title": "Comparison of total and cytoplasmic mRNA reveals global regulation by nuclear retention and miRNAs.", "authors": [{"family": "Solnestam", "given": "Beata Werne", "initials": "BW"}, {"family": "Stranneheim", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "H\u00e4llman", "given": "Jimmie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "K\u00e4ller", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Akan", "given": "Pelin", "initials": "P"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2012-10-30", "journal": {"volume": "13", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": null, "pages": "574", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "The majority of published gene-expression studies have used RNA isolated from whole cells, overlooking the potential impact of including nuclear transcriptome in the analyses.

This co-localization was also seen in human, but not in rat DRGs. Scgn could be detected in the mouse sciatic nerve and accumulated proximal to its constriction. In mouse spinal cord, Scgn-positive neuronal cell bodies and fibers were found in gray matter, especially in the dorsal horn, with particularly high concentrations of fibers in the superficial laminae, as well as in cell bodies in inner lamina II and in some other laminae. A dense Scgn-positive fiber network and some small cell bodies were also found in the superficial dorsal horn of humans. In the ventral horn, a small number of neurons were Scgn-positive in mouse but not rat, confirming mRNA distribution. Both in mouse and rat, a subset of TG neurons contained Scgn.

The interaction between IQGAP1 and 3O-C(12)-HSL was further confirmed by pull-down assay using a GST-tagged protein with subsequent Western blot of IQGAP1 and by identifying 3O-C(12)-HSL with a sensor bioassay. Moreover, 3O-C(12)-HSL induced changes in the phosphorylation status of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the localization of IQGAP1 as evidenced by confocal and STED microscopy and Western blots.

Differently from Crabtree positive yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the onset of fermentation in S. stipitis is not dependent on the sugar concentration, but is regulated by a decrease in oxygen levels. Even though S. stipitis has been extensively studied due to its potential application in pentoses fermentation, a limited amount of information is available about its metabolism during aerobic growth on glucose. Here, we provide a systems biology based comparison between the two yeasts, uncovering the metabolism of S. stipitis during aerobic growth on glucose under batch and chemostat cultivations.\n\nStarting from the analysis of physiological data, we confirmed through 13C-based flux analysis the fully respiratory metabolism of S. stipitis when growing both under glucose limited or glucose excess conditions. The patterns observed showed similarity to the fully respiratory metabolism observed for S. cerevisiae under chemostat cultivations however, intracellular metabolome analysis uncovered the presence of several differences in metabolite patterns. To describe gene expression levels under the two conditions, we performed RNA sequencing and the results were used to quantify transcript abundances of genes from the central carbon metabolism and compared with those obtained with S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, genes involved in central pathways showed different patterns of expression, suggesting different regulatory networks between the two yeasts. Efforts were focused on identifying shared and unique families of transcription factors between the two yeasts through in silico transcription factors analysis, suggesting a different regulation of glycolytic and glucoenogenic pathways.\n\nThe work presented addresses the impact of high-throughput methods in describing and comparing the physiology of Crabtree positive and Crabtree negative yeasts. Based on physiological data and flux analysis we identified the presence of one metabolic condition for S. stipitis under aerobic batch and chemostat cultivations, which shows similarities to the oxidative metabolism observed for S. cerevisiae under chemostat cultivations. Through metabolome analysis and genome-wide transcriptomic analysis several differences were identified. Interestingly, in silico analysis of transciption factors was useful to address a different regulation of mRNAs of genes involved in the central carbon metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the metabolism of S. stiptis is investigated in details and is compared to S. cerevisiae.

However, by serendipity, the linker region of the purification tag binds in the chaperone binding groove of the IF domain, making this the first structure of an FKBP-IF protein in complex with a mimic of an unfolded chaperone substrate. The linker binds by \u03b2-sheet augmentation, thus completing the incomplete \u03b2 barrel of the IF domain and shielding a considerable hydrophobic surface area from the solvent. Interestingly, a proline residue in trans configuration appears to be specifically recognized in a small pocket within the binding groove. Hence, the IF domain can preselect and prealign substrates with proline residues, which may explain how it enhances the catalytic efficiency and modulates the specificity of the FKBP domain in addition to its chaperone function.

Amylase and lysozyme were inspected as possible major enzymatic activities in the mandibular glands aiding in pre-digestion and antimicrobial defense. Although detected, neither of these enzymatic activities was prominent in the luminal protein preparation of a particular type of gland.

For this purpose, nine parathyroid tumors with established CDC73 gene inactivating mutations (three carcinomas, one atypical adenoma and five adenomas) were analyzed for copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity using array-comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, respectively. Furthermore, CDC73 gene promoter methylation levels were assessed using bisulfite Pyrosequencing. The panel included seven tumors with single mutation and three with double mutations of the CDC73 gene. The carcinomas displayed copy number alterations in agreement with previous studies, whereas the CDC73-mutated adenomas did not display the same pattern of alterations at loci frequently deleted in unselected parathyroid tumors. Furthermore, gross losses of chromosomal material at 1p and 13 were significantly (p\u200a=\u200a0.012) associated with parathyroid carcinomas as opposed to adenomas. Quantitative PCR-based copy number loss regarding CDC73 was observed in three adenomas, while all the carcinomas were diploid or showed copy number gain for CDC73 gene.

Gingival biopsies were obtained from a disease-affected and a healthy site from each of 10 individuals diagnosed with periodontitis. Enrichment analysis performed among uniquely expressed genes for the periodontitis-affected and healthy tissues revealed several regulated pathways indicative of inflammation for the periodontitis-affected condition. Hierarchical clustering of the sequenced biopsies demonstrated clustering according to the degree of inflammation, as observed histologically in the biopsies, rather than clustering at the individual level. Among the top 50 upregulated genes in periodontitis-affected tissues, we investigated two genes which have not previously been demonstrated to be involved in periodontitis. These included interferon regulatory factor 4 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18, which were also expressed at the protein level in gingival biopsies from patients with periodontitis. In conclusion, this study provides a first step towards a quantitative comprehensive insight into the transcriptome changes in periodontitis. We demonstrate for the first time site-specific local variation in gene expression profiles of periodontitis-affected and healthy tissues obtained from patients with periodontitis, using RNA-seq.

Further, extl3 mutants produced higher levels of CS than control larvae, whereas morpholino-mediated suppression of csgalnact1/csgalnact2 resulted in increased HS biosynthesis.

Enhanced phosphorylation of tau on Ser(262) is detected early in the course of the disease and may have a role in the formation of tangles. Several kinases such as microtubule-affinity regulating kinase (MARK), protein kinase A, calcium calmodulin kinase II, and checkpoint kinase 2 are known to phosphorylate tau on Ser(262) in vitro. In this study, we took advantage of the in situ proximity ligation assay to investigate the role of MARK2, one of the four MARK isoforms, in AD. We demonstrate that MARK2 interacts with tau and phosphorylates tau at Ser(262) in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing human recombinant tau. Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the interaction between MARK2 and tau, and also phosphorylation of tau at Ser(262). Furthermore, we observed elevated interactions between MARK2 and tau in post-mortem human AD brains, compared to samples from non-demented elderly controls. Our results from transfected cells demonstrate a specific interaction between MARK2 and tau, as well as MARK2-dependent phosphorylation of tau at Ser(262).

This question can be addressed by studying twins discordant or concordant for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nWe investigated microscopic structures in CSF in 102 individuals: 21 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic twins affected or not affected with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder and in 65 healthy singleton controls. A first and a second fraction of CSF was freshly applied on filters and examined by scanning electron microscopy technique.

The present study aims to investigate how sepsis aggravates ventilator and immobilization-related limb muscle dysfunction. Hence, biceps femoris muscle gene expression was investigated in pigs exposed to ICU intervention, i.e., immobilization, sedation, and MV, alone or in combination with sepsis, for 5 days.

According to microarray data, the addition of sepsis to the ICU intervention induced a deregulation of > 500 genes, such as an increased expression of genes involved in chemokine activity, kinase activity, and transcriptional regulation. Genes involved in the regulation of the oxidative stress response and cytoskeletal/sarcomeric and heat shock proteins were on the other hand downregulated when sepsis was added to the ICU intervention.

Recombinant 13R-MnLOX oxidizes 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 to 13R-, 11(S or R)-, and 9S-hydroperoxy metabolites (\u223c80-85, 15-20, and 2-3%, respectively) by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation.

The abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen of 18:2n-6 was retained, suggesting antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. Replacement of Leu(336) with smaller hydrophobic residues (Val, Ala, and Gly) shifted the oxygenation from C-13 toward C-9 with formation of 9S- and 9R-hydroperoxy metabolites of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3.

This finding offers a possible explanation to the clinically known fact that some PVD patients improve after cessation of hormonal contraceptives, indicating that PVD patients carrying the defined SNP combination of GCH1 would benefit from this intervention.", "doi": "10.1186/1744-8069-8-68", "pmid": "22971341", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1744-8069-8-68"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3489821"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9f3eac7955274b349e93cf9948fbee23.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9f3eac7955274b349e93cf9948fbee23"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fd5339728a92423293ad65afe5cbdb19", "title": "Evolutionary conservation of the ribosomal biogenesis factor Rbm19/Mrd1: implications for function.", "authors": [{"family": "Kallberg", "given": "Yvonne", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Segerstolpe", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Lackmann", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Wieslander", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-09-12", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "9", "pages": "e43786", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes requires coordinated folding and assembly of a pre-rRNA into sequential pre-rRNA-protein complexes in which chemical modifications and RNA cleavages occur. These processes require many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and proteins. Rbm19/Mrd1 is one such protein that is built from multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs). We find that Rbm19/Mrd1 with five RBDs is present in all branches of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree, except in animals and Choanoflagellates, that instead have a version with six RBDs and Microsporidia which have a minimal Rbm19/Mrd1 protein with four RBDs. Rbm19/Mrd1 therefore evolved as a multi-RBD protein very early in eukaryotes. The linkers between the RBDs have conserved properties; they are disordered, except for linker 3, and position the RBDs at conserved relative distances from each other. All but one of the RBDs have conserved properties for RNA-binding and each RBD has a specific consensus sequence and a conserved position in the protein, suggesting a functionally important modular design. The patterns of evolutionary conservation provide information for experimental analyses of the function of Rbm19/Mrd1.

We identified genes affected by drug exposure and present in tissues associated with toxicity. From ten top-ranked genes 42 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in silico and genotyped in 94 cancer patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel.

Scaffolding provides estimates about the order, relative orientation and distance between contigs.

Since erroneous distance estimates can mislead in subsequent analysis, it is important to provide unbiased estimation of contig distance.\n\nIn this article, we show that state-of-the-art programs for scaffolding are using an incorrect model of gap size estimation. We discuss why current maximum likelihood estimators are biased and describe what different cases of bias we are facing. Furthermore, we provide a model for the distribution of reads that span a gap and derive the maximum likelihood equation for the gap length. We motivate why this estimate is sound and show empirically that it outperforms gap estimators in popular scaffolding programs.

Loci influencing fasting insulin concentration showed association with lipid levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on insulin resistance. Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations.

This has revolutionized the fields of genetics and biology, leading to a deeper understanding of the molecular events in life processes. The rapid technological advances have enormously expanded sequencing opportunities and applications, but also imposed strains and challenges on steps prior to sequencing and in the downstream process of handling and analysis of these massive amounts of sequence data. Traditionally, sequencing has been limited to small DNA fragments of approximately one thousand bases (derived from the organism's genome) due to issues in maintaining a high sequence quality and accuracy for longer read lengths. Although many technological breakthroughs have been made, currently the commercially available massively parallel sequencing methods have not been able to resolve this issue. However, recent announcements in nanopore sequencing hold the promise of removing this read-length limitation, enabling sequencing of larger intact DNA fragments. The ability to sequence longer intact DNA with high accuracy is a major stepping stone towards greatly simplifying the downstream analysis and increasing the power of sequencing compared to today.

For instance, the eukaryotic protein filamin interacts with many proteins and is crucial for the cytoskeleton. The functional properties of long repeat domains are governed by the specific properties of each individual domain as well as by the repeat copy number. To provide better understanding of the evolutionary and functional history of repeating domains, we investigated the mode of evolution of the filamin domain in some detail. Among the domains that are common in long repeat proteins, sushi and spectrin domains evolve primarily through cassette tandem duplications while scavenger and immunoglobulin repeats appear to evolve through clustered tandem duplications. Additionally, immunoglobulin and filamin repeats exhibit a unique pattern where every other domain shows high sequence similarity. This pattern may be the result of tandem duplications, serve to avert aggregation between adjacent domains or it is the result of functional constraints. In filamin, our studies confirm the presence of interspersed integrin binding domains in vertebrates, while invertebrates exhibit more varied patterns, including more clustered integrin binding domains. The most notable case is leech filamin, which contains a 20 repeat expansion and exhibits unique dimerization topology. Clearly, invertebrate filamins are varied and contain examples of similar adjacent integrin-binding domains. Given that invertebrate integrin shows more similarity to the weaker filamin binder, integrin \u03b23, it is possible that the distance between integrin-binding domains is not as crucial for invertebrate filamins as for vertebrates.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jsb.2012.02.010", "pmid": "22414427", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1047-8477(12)00063-9"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3728663"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS470530"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8ac40d6bdf594ad68f2c6a1b5740ee67.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8ac40d6bdf594ad68f2c6a1b5740ee67"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "febbdae8a9934f24b045fce3a12cd7ce", "title": "Global transcriptional response to ISCOM-Matrix adjuvant at the site of administration and in the draining lymph node early after intramuscular injection in pigs.", "authors": [{"family": "Ahlberg", "given": "Viktor", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "L\u00f6vgren Bengtsson", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wallgren", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Fossum", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-09-00", "journal": {"volume": "38", "issn": "1879-0089", "issue": "1", "pages": "17-26", "title": "Dev.

Gene enrichment analysis revealed inflammation, innate immunity and antigen processing to be central in the ISCOM-Matrix response. At the injection site, 594 genes were differentially expressed, including up-regulation of the cytokines osteopontin (SPP1), IL-10 and IL-18 and the chemokines CCL2, CCL19 and CXCL16. Of the 362 genes differentially expressed in the lymph node, IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL11 were up-regulated whereas IL18, CCL15 and CXCL12 were down-regulated.

MiRNA expression profiles in healthy skins (n = 4) and cSCCs (n = 4) were analyzed using MicroRNA Low Density Array. MiR-125b expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization in skin biopsies from 40 healthy donors, 13 actinic keratosis, and 74 cSCC patients. The effect of miR-125b was analyzed in wound closure, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays in two cSCC cell lines, UT-SCC-7 and A431. The genes regulated by miR-125b in cSCC were identified by microarray analysis and its direct target was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Comparing cSCC with healthy skin, we identified four up-regulated miRNAs (miR-31, miR-135b, miR-21, and miR-223) and 54 down-regulated miRNAs, including miR-125b, whose function was further examined. We found that miR-125b suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migratory, and invasive capacity of cSCC cells. Matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was identified as a direct target suppressed by miR-125b, and there was an inverse relationship between the expression of miR-125b and MMP13 in cSCC.

We identify 89 putative Fbw7 substrates, including several disease-associated proteins. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB2 (p100/p52) is one of the candidate Fbw7 substrates.

Fbw7 inactivation increases p100 levels, which in the presence of NF-\u03baB pathway stimuli, leads to increased p52 levels and activity. Accordingly, the apoptotic threshold can be increased by loss of Fbw7 in a p100-dependent manner.

However, since there are more than 70 \u03b3-secretase substrates besides APP, selective inhibition of APP processing is required. Recent data indicates the existence of several \u03b3-secretase associated proteins (GSAPs) that affect the selection and processing of substrates. Here, we use a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase and associated proteins from microsomes and detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) prepared from rat or human brain. By tandem mass spectrometry we identified a novel brain GSAP; erlin-2. This protein was recently reported to reside in DRMs in the ER. A proximity ligation assay, as well as co-immunoprecipitation, confirmed the association of erlin-2 with \u03b3-secretase. We found that a higher proportion of erlin-2 was associated with \u03b3-secretase in DRMs than in soluble membranes. siRNA experiments indicated that reduced levels of erlin-2 resulted in a decreased A\u03b2 production, whereas the effect on Notch processing was limited.

Diversity was consistently lower in the biofilm communities than in the suspended stream water communities. We propose that the higher diversity in the suspended communities is supported by continuous inflow from various sources within the catchment. Community composition clearly differed between biofilms and suspended communities, whereas biofilm communities were similar in all three streams. This suggests that biofilm assembly did not simply reflect differences in the source communities, but that certain microbial groups from the source community proliferate in the biofilm. We compared the biofilm communities with random samples of the respective community suspended in the stream water. This analysis confirmed that stochastic dispersal from the source community was unlikely to shape the observed community composition of the biofilms, in support of species sorting as a major biofilm assembly mechanism.

We used so called context-independent-motif-specific antibodies, directed against short amino acid motifs. This enabled enrichment of motif-containing peptides from a digested proteome, which then were detected and identified by mass spectrometry. In this study, we have demonstrated the quantitative capability, reproducibility, sensitivity, and coverage of the global proteome survey technology by targeting stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-labeled yeast cultures cultivated in glucose or ethanol. The data showed that a wide range of motif-containing peptides (proteins) could be detected, identified, and quantified in a highly reproducible manner. On average, each of six different motif-specific antibodies was found to target about 75 different motif-containing proteins. Furthermore, peptides originating from proteins spanning in abundance from over a million down to less than 50 copies per cell, could be targeted. It is worth noting that a significant set of peptides previously not reported in the PeptideAtlas database was among the profiled targets. The quantitative data corroborated well with the corresponding data generated after conventional strong cation exchange fractionation of the same samples. Finally, several differentially expressed proteins, with both known and unknown functions, many relevant for the central carbon metabolism, could be detected in the glucose- versus ethanol-cultivated yeast.

CpG methylation between mononuclear cells and granulocytes differed for 22% of the 8252 probes covering the selected 343 genes implicated in immune-related disorders by genome-wide association studies, and at least one probe was differentially methylated for 85% of the genes, indicating that whole blood methylation results might be unintelligible.

However, considering exon specific expression, the association was greatly reduced for exon 2 (4.5\u00d710\u207b\u2075) compared to exons 3-6 (10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 to 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070), suggesting rs11573156 G allele-specific exon 2 skipping.\n\nBoth SNPs are functional and provide useful tools for Mendelian Randomisation to determine whether the relationship between sPLA2-IIA and coronary heart disease is causal.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0041139", "pmid": "22879865", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-11961"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3412631"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/815a472b1ede4289b7872379d1eb350b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/815a472b1ede4289b7872379d1eb350b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "94208020417e409086bbd8fe9ba46ad9", "title": "Small molecule screening for inhibitors of the YopH phosphatase of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.", "authors": [{"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Grundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Christin", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sauer-Eriksson", "given": "A Elisabeth", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Sauer", "given": "Uwe H", "initials": "UH"}, {"family": "Wolf-Watz", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Elofsson", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-07-12", "journal": {"volume": "954", "issn": "0065-2598", "issue": null, "pages": "357-363", "title": "Adv.

We have established a scalable technique to compare two biological samples for the levels of all pairwise interactions among a set of targeted protein molecules. The technique is a combination of the proximity ligation assay with readout via dual tag microarrays. In the proximity ligation assay protein identities are encoded as DNA sequences by attaching DNA oligonucleotides to antibodies directed against the proteins of interest. Upon binding by pairs of antibodies to proteins present in the same molecular complexes, ligation reactions give rise to reporter DNA molecules that contain the combined sequence information from the two DNA strands. The ligation reactions also serve to incorporate a sample barcode in the reporter molecules to allow for direct comparison between pairs of samples. The samples are evaluated using a dual tag microarray where information is decoded, revealing which pairs of tags that have become joined. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate that this approach can be used to detect a set of five proteins and their pairwise interactions both in cellular lysates and in fixed tissue culture cells.

In this work we investigated the effect of ethanol on the apparent solubility and dissolution rate of poorly soluble compounds in simulated intestinal fluid representing a preprandial state. A series of 22 structurally diverse, poorly soluble compounds were measured for apparent solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate (37 \u00b0C) in phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (PhB6.5) and fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF, pH 6.5) with and without ethanol at 5% v/v or 20% v/v. The obtained data were used to understand for which molecules ethanol results in an increased apparent solubility and, therefore, may increase the amount of drug absorbed. In FaSSIF20%ethanol 59% of the compounds displayed >3-fold higher apparent solubility than in pure FaSSIF, whereas the effects of 5% ethanol on solubility, in most cases, were negligible. Acidic and neutral compounds were more solubilized by the addition of ethanol than by lecithin/taurocholate aggregates, whereas bases showed a more substance-specific response to the additives in the buffer. The stronger solubilizing capacity of ethanol as compared to the mixed lipid aggregates in FaSSIF was further identified through Spearman rank analyses, which showed a stronger relationship between FaSSIF20%ethanol and PhB6.5,20%ethanol (rS of 0.97) than FaSSIF20%ethanol and FaSSIF (rS of 0.86). No relationships were found between solubility changes in media containing ethanol and single physicochemical properties, but multivariate data analysis showed that inclusion of ethanol significantly reduced the negative effect of compound lipophilicity on solubility. For this data set the higher concentration of ethanol gave a dose number (Do) <1 for 30% of the compounds that showed incomplete dissolution in FaSSIF. Significant differences were shown in the melting point, lipophilicity, and dose profiles between the compounds having a Do < 1 and Do > 1, with the latter having higher absolute values in all three parameters. In conclusion, this study showed that significant effects of ethanol on apparent solubility in the preprandial state can be expected for lipophilic compounds.

However, it has often been questioned whether HFCs reflect general inbreeding depression, because a small panel of microsatellite markers does not reflect very well an individual's inbreeding coefficient (F) as calculated from a pedigree. Here, we challenge this prevailing view. Because of chance events during Mendelian segregation, an individual's realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBD) may substantially deviate from the pedigree-based expectation (i.e. F). This Mendelian noise may result in a weak correlation between F and multi-locus heterozygosity, but this does not imply that multi-locus heterozygosity is a bad estimator of realized IBD. We examined correlations between 11 fitness-related traits measured in up to 1192 captive zebra finches and three measures of inbreeding: (i) heterozygosity across 11 microsatellite markers, (ii) heterozygosity across 1359 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and (iii) F, based on a 5th-generation pedigree. All 11 phenotypic traits showed positive relationships with measures of heterozygosity, especially traits that are most closely related to fitness. Remarkably, the small panel of microsatellite markers produced equally strong HFCs as the large panel of SNP markers. Both marker-based approaches produced stronger correlations with phenotypes than the pedigree-based F, and this did not seem to result from the shortness of our pedigree. We argue that a small panel of microsatellites with high allelic richness may better reflect an individual's realized IBD than previously appreciated, especially in species like the zebra finch, where much of the genome is inherited in large blocks that rarely experience cross-over during meiosis.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05593.x", "pmid": "22554318", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/efe49673e51f460dbdd00db39b1312a0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/efe49673e51f460dbdd00db39b1312a0"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8d686769990245d6bee2d1286d5dd436", "title": "Preferential genome targeting of the CBP co-activator by Rel and Smad proteins in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos.", "authors": [{"family": "Holmqvist", "given": "Per-Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Boija", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Philip", "given": "Philge", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Crona", "given": "Filip", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Stenberg", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mannervik", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-06-21", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "6", "pages": "e1002769", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "CBP and the related p300 protein are widely used transcriptional co-activators in metazoans that interact with multiple transcription factors.

These IgAN loci are associated with risk of other immune-mediated disorders such as type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. We tested association of these loci in eight new independent cohorts of Asian, European, and African-American ancestry (N\u200a=\u200a4,789), followed by meta-analysis with risk-score modeling in 12 cohorts (N\u200a=\u200a10,755) and geospatial analysis in 85 world populations. Four susceptibility loci robustly replicated and all five loci were genome-wide significant in the combined cohort (P\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u00b2-3\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2070), with heterogeneity detected only at the PSMB9/TAP1 locus (I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.60). Conditional analyses identified two new independent risk alleles within the HLA-DQB1/DRB1 locus, defining multiple risk and protective haplotypes within this interval.

This model paralleled the known East-West gradient in disease risk. Moreover, the prediction of a South-North axis was confirmed by registry data showing that the prevalence of IgAN-attributable kidney failure is increased in Northern Europe, similar to multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. Variation at IgAN susceptibility loci correlates with differences in disease prevalence among world populations.

Marine arctic amphipod populations (Orchomenella pinguis) were collected from sites within a contaminated fjord, as well as from sites outside the fjord on the west-coast of Greenland over three years (2006-2008). Impacts on genetic diversity, effects on resilience such as development of tolerance and cost were determined. AFLP-analysis was used to explore within and between population genetic diversity, and exposure studies were performed where the populations were subjected to known and unknown stressors to assess resilience. Populations collected at three contaminated sites all had reduced genetic diversity in 2007 compared to populations outside the fjord. This pattern was different in 2008 as all contaminated site populations increased in diversity, whereas a decrease in diversity occurred at the outer sites. However, tolerance, but even more so, cost, was related to contamination exposure in 2008, in spite of the shift in genetic diversity. We suggest that contamination rapidly induces effects that can be captured as tolerance and associated cost, whereas effects on genetic diversity can be difficult to separate from recent migration events that dilute eventual decreases in diversity due to contamination pressure. As long as impacted populations can be influenced by migration events that increase the genetic diversity and add health to an affected population, populations in contaminated areas may have enhanced probability of survival.", "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.02.003", "pmid": "22421731", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0166-445X(12)00053-7"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0224e341360f4089a0ae4444c38f10ef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0224e341360f4089a0ae4444c38f10ef"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1c65428b58d9411b8a95e81e4cab18b5", "title": "Validation of affinity reagents using antigen microarrays.", "authors": [{"family": "Sj\u00f6berg", "given": "Ronald", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Sundberg", "given": "M\u00e5rten", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gundberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sivertsson", "given": "Asa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-06-15", "journal": {"volume": "29", "issn": "1876-4347", "issue": "5", "pages": "555-563", "title": "N Biotechnol"}, "abstract": "There is a need for standardised validation of affinity reagents to determine their binding selectivity and specificity.

Finally, BR decreased with increasing lake and catchment area that is negative species-area relationships (SARs) were recorded; a finding that re-opens the debate about whether positive SARs can indeed be found in the microbial world and whether positive SARs can in fact be pronounced as one of the few 'laws' in ecology.", "doi": "10.1038/ismej.2011.184", "pmid": "22170419", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ismej2011184"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3358030"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/758e1c055935406dad8dddc45a6c2d60.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/758e1c055935406dad8dddc45a6c2d60"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7b404f49104f43e8920d6cbca0d50c4a", "title": "Common and low-frequency genetic variants in the PCSK9 locus influence circulating PCSK9 levels.", "authors": [{"family": "Chernogubova", "given": "Ekaterina", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Strawbridge", "given": "Rona", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Mahdessian", "given": "Hovsep", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "M\u00e4larstig", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Krapivner", "given": "Sergey", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gigante", "given": "Bruna", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Hell\u00e9nius", "given": "Mai-Lis", "initials": "ML"}, {"family": "de Faire", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Franco-Cereceda", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Syv\u00e4nen", "given": "Ann-Christine", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Troutt", "given": "Jason S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Konrad", "given": "Robert J", "initials": "RJ"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "van 't Hooft", "given": "Ferdinand M", "initials": "FM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "32", "issn": "1524-4636", "issue": "6", "pages": "1526-1534", "title": "Arterioscler.

It is, hence, important to know to what depth microbial communities need to be sampled to accurately measure trends in diversity.

Here we show that Rose-comb is caused by a 7.4 Mb inversion on chromosome 7 and that a second Rose-comb allele arose by unequal crossing over between a Rose-comb and wild-type chromosome. The comb phenotype is caused by the relocalization of the MNR2 homeodomain protein gene leading to transient ectopic expression of MNR2 during comb development. We also provide a molecular explanation for the first example of epistatic interaction reported by Bateson and Punnett 104 years ago, namely that walnut-comb is caused by the combined effects of the Rose-comb and Pea-comb alleles. Transient ectopic expression of MNR2 and SOX5 (causing the Pea-comb phenotype) occurs in the same population of mesenchymal cells and with at least partially overlapping expression in individual cells in the comb primordium. Rose-comb has pleiotropic effects, as homozygosity in males has been associated with poor sperm motility. We postulate that this is caused by the disruption of the CCDC108 gene located at one of the inversion breakpoints. CCDC108 is a poorly characterized protein, but it contains a MSP (major sperm protein) domain and is expressed in testis.

The microarray results demonstrated that several genes were differentially expressed.

More recently, GABA has been ascribed a more widespread role in the control of cell proliferation during development where low concentrations of extrasynaptic GABA induce a tonic activation of GABA receptors. The GABA-A receptor consists of a ligand-gated chloride channel, formed by five subunits that are selected from 19 different subunit isoforms. The functional and pharmacological properties of the GABA-A channels are dictated by their subunit composition. Here we used qRT-PCR to compare mRNA levels of all 19 GABA-A channel subunits in samples of human glioma (n = 29) and peri-tumoral tissue (n = 5). All subunits except the \u03c11 and \u03c13 subunit were consistently detected. Lowest mRNA levels were found in glioblastoma compared to gliomas of lower malignancy, except for the \u03b8 subunit.

We performed genome-wide association of abdominal adipose depots quantified using computed tomography (CT) to uncover novel loci for body fat distribution among participants of European ancestry. Subcutaneous and visceral fat were quantified in 5,560 women and 4,997 men from 4 population-based studies. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using standard arrays and imputed to ~2.5 million Hapmap SNPs. Each study performed a genome-wide association analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), VAT adjusted for body mass index, and VAT/SAT ratio (a metric of the propensity to store fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously) in the overall sample and in women and men separately. A weighted z-score meta-analysis was conducted. For the VAT/SAT ratio, our most significant p-value was rs11118316 at LYPLAL1 gene (p = 3.1 \u00d7 10E-09), previously identified in association with waist-hip ratio. For SAT, the most significant SNP was in the FTO gene (p = 5.9 \u00d7 10E-08). Given the known gender differences in body fat distribution, we performed sex-specific analyses. Our most significant finding was for VAT in women, rs1659258 near THNSL2 (p = 1.6 \u00d7 10-08), but not men (p = 0.75). Validation of this SNP in the GIANT consortium data demonstrated a similar sex-specific pattern, with observed significance in women (p = 0.006) but not men (p = 0.24) for BMI and waist circumference (p = 0.04 [women], p = 0.49 [men]). Finally, we interrogated our data for the 14 recently published loci for body fat distribution (measured by waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI); associations were observed at 7 of these loci. In contrast, we observed associations at only 7/32 loci previously identified in association with BMI; the majority of overlap was observed with SAT. Genome-wide association for visceral and subcutaneous fat revealed a SNP for VAT in women.

Genotype and gene expression profiles were obtained from carotid plaque tissue (n = 126) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 97) of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Patients were followed for an average of 44 months, and 25 ischemic events occurred (18 ischemic strokes and 7 myocardial infarctions). Blinded leave-one-out cross-validation on Cox regression coefficients was used to assign gene expression-based risk scores to each patient. When compared with classic risk factors, addition of carotid plaque gene expression-based risk score improved the prediction of future ischemic events from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 to an AUC of 0.79. The inclusion of gene expression risk score from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or from 25 established myocardial infarction risk single nucleotide polymorphisms only exhibited marginal effects on the prediction of ischemic events. Prediction of ischemic events is improved by inclusion of gene expression profiling from carotid endarterectomy tissue compared with prediction on the basis of classic risk markers alone in patients with atherosclerosis.

They can be obtained directly from food, e.g., fish, or synthesized from precursor molecules found in vegetable oils. To determine the importance of genetic variability to fatty-acid biosynthesis, we studied FADS1 and FADS2, which encode rate-limiting enzymes for fatty-acid conversion. We performed genome-wide genotyping (n = 5,652 individuals) and targeted resequencing (n = 960 individuals) of the FADS region in five European population cohorts. We also analyzed available genomic data from human populations, archaic hominins, and more distant primates. Our results show that present-day humans have two common FADS haplotypes-defined by 28 closely linked SNPs across 38.9 kb-that differ dramatically in their ability to generate LC-PUFAs. No independent effects on FADS activity were seen for rare SNPs detected by targeted resequencing. The more efficient, evolutionarily derived haplotype appeared after the lineage split leading to modern humans and Neanderthals and shows evidence of positive selection. This human-specific haplotype increases the efficiency of synthesizing essential long-chain fatty acids from precursors and thereby might have provided an advantage in environments with limited access to dietary LC-PUFAs.

Complete loss-of-function of both splice-forms is lethal, whereas selective absence of the type 2-form reduces the adult lifespan of the fly and causes developmental abnormalities in male genitalia.\n\nOut of 7004-7979 transcripts expressed in the four sample groups, 5587 (70-79%) were found in all four tissues and strains. Here, we investigated the role of Btk29A type 2 on a transcriptomic level in larval CNS and adult heads. We used samples either selectively defective in Btk29A type 2 (Btk29A(ficP)) or revertant flies with restored Btk29A type 2-function (Btk29A(fic Exc1-16)). The whole transcriptomic profile for the different sample groups revealed Gene Ontology patterns reflecting lifespan abnormalities in adult head neuronal tissue, but not in larvae.\n\nIn the Btk29A type 2-deficient strains there was no significant overlap between transcriptomic alterations in adult heads and larvae neuronal tissue, respectively. Moreover, there was no significant overlap of the transcriptomic changes between flies and mammals, suggesting that the evolutionary conservation is confined to components of the proximal signaling, whereas the corresponding, downstream transcriptional regulation has been differentially wired.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035640", "pmid": "22574122", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-01915"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3344829"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ff433a09d59b40f384ae09e8d57426af.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ff433a09d59b40f384ae09e8d57426af"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "65f3916f49f14417a25de1d57057d0ef", "title": "A comprehensive analysis of human gene expression profiles identifies stromal immunoglobulin \u03ba C as a compatible prognostic marker in human solid tumors.", "authors": [{"family": "Schmidt", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hellwig", "given": "Birte", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Hammad", "given": "Seddik", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Othman", "given": "Amnah", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lohr", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Zonglin", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Boehm", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Gebhard", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Petry", "given": "Ilka", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Lebrecht", "given": "Antje", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cadenas", "given": "Cristina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Marchan", "given": "Rosemarie", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Stewart", "given": "Joanna D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Solbach", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Holmberg", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Edlund", "given": "Karolina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Kultima", "given": "Hanna G\u00f6ransson", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Rody", "given": "Achim", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Berglund", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lambe", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Isaksson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Botling", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Karn", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "M\u00fcller", "given": "Volkmar", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Gerhold-Ay", "given": "Aslihan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cotarelo", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Sebastian", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kronenwett", "given": "Ralf", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bojar", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lehr", "given": "Hans-Anton", "initials": "HA"}, {"family": "Sahin", "given": "Ugur", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Koelbl", "given": "Heinz", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gehrmann", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Micke", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Rahnenf\u00fchrer", "given": "J\u00f6rg", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hengstler", "given": "Jan G", "initials": "JG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "18", "issn": "1078-0432", "issue": "9", "pages": "2695-2703", "title": "Clin.

To investigate these pathways we subjected domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) to intermittent social isolation for the first three weeks of life. The early life stress resulted in a dampened corticosterone response to restraint stress in affected birds and in their male offspring. Stress-specific genes, such as early growth response 1 (EGR1) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), were upregulated immediately after restraint stress, but not under baseline conditions.

Moreover, the ones that have been replicated explain only a small proportion of the heritability (<~2%).

Using a custom-designed assay, we measured the methylation levels of 1,320 CpG sites in regulatory regions of 413 genes that were analyzed because they display allele-specific gene expression (ASE) in ALL cells. The rationale for our selection of CpG sites was that ASE could be the result of allele-specific methylation in the promoter regions of the genes. We found that the ALL cells had methylation profiles that allowed distinction between ALL cells and control cells. Using stringent criteria for calling differential methylation, we identified 28 CpG sites in 24 genes with recurrent differences in their methylation levels between ALL cells and control cells.

Recent studies indicate that replacement of particular codons for synonymous codons can improve expression in homologous or heterologous hosts, however it is not always successful. Furthermore it is increasingly apparent that membrane protein biogenesis can be codon-sensitive. Single synonymous codon substitutions can influence mRNA stability, mRNA structure, translational initiation, translational elongation and even protein folding. Synonymous codon substitutions therefore need to be carefully evaluated when membrane proteins are engineered for higher production levels and further studies are needed to fully understand how to select the codons that are optimal for higher production.

Here we addressed this issue by examining the interaction between Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells and MCs.

Indeed, transwell migration assays showed that LLC-conditioned medium had chemotactic activity towards MCs, which was blocked by an antibody towards stem cell factor. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms operative in tumor-MC interactions, the effect of LLC on the MC gene expression pattern was examined. As judged by gene array analysis, conditioned medium from LLC cells caused significant upregulation of numerous cell surface receptors and a pro-angiogenic Runx2/VEGF/Dusp5 axis in MCs, the latter in line with a role for MCs in promoting tumor angiogenesis. Among the genes showing the highest extent of upregulation was Tnfrsf9, encoding the anti-tumorigenic protein 4-1BB, suggesting that also anti-tumorigenic factors are induced. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that 4-1BB was upregulated in a transient manner, and it was also shown that tumor cells induce 4-1BB in human MCs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LLC-conditioned medium induced 4-1BB also at the protein level. Together, this study provides novel insight into the molecular events associated with MC-tumor interactions and suggests that tumor cells induce both pro- and anti-tumorigenic responses in MCs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molimm.2012.01.009", "pmid": "22343053", "labels": {"Array and Analysis Facility": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0161-5890(12)00010-7"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/10cde2acbb4747dab0b852f5fad4d773.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/10cde2acbb4747dab0b852f5fad4d773"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5742a85722674d7db890394136a8ac05", "title": "Can weed hosts increase aggressiveness of Phytophthora infestans on potato?", "authors": [{"family": "Gr\u00f6nberg", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "B", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Yuen", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "102", "issn": "0031-949X", "issue": "4", "pages": "429-433", "title": "Phytopathology"}, "abstract": "Potato late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is a major disease in potato production throughout the world.

These signals regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes to match the current status of the plastids. Using forward genetics we identified PLASTID REDOX INSENSITIVE 2 (PRIN2), a chloroplast component involved in redox-mediated retrograde signalling. The allelic mutants prin2-1 and prin2-2 demonstrated a misregulation of photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene expression in response to excess light, and an inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport. As a consequence of the misregulation of LHCB1.1 and LHCB2.4, the prin2 mutants displayed a high irradiance-sensitive phenotype with significant photoinactivation of photosystem II, indicated by a reduced variable to maximal fluorescence ratio (F(v) /F(m) ). PRIN2 is localized to the nucleoids, and plastid transcriptome analyses demonstrated that PRIN2 is required for full expression of genes transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP). Similarly to the prin2 mutants, the ys1 mutant with impaired PEP activity also demonstrated a misregulation of LHCB1.1 and LHCB2.4 expression in response to excess light, suggesting a direct role for PEP activity in redox-mediated retrograde signalling. Taken together, our results indicate that PRIN2 is part of the PEP machinery, and that the PEP complex responds to photosynthetic electron transport and generates a retrograde signal, enabling the plant to synchronize the expression of photosynthetic genes from both the nuclear and plastidic genomes.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04865.x", "pmid": "22211401", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5ebd38fdc77348bd9ee901fff7f987e4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5ebd38fdc77348bd9ee901fff7f987e4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "899c6c42cf0f43beba9c286b08fbfb10", "title": "Proteinase production in Pseudomonas fluorescens ON2 is affected by carbon sources and allows surface-attached but not planktonic cells to utilize protein for growth in lake water.", "authors": [{"family": "Nicolaisen", "given": "Mette H", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Worm", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "J\u00f8rgensen", "given": "Niels O G", "initials": "NO"}, {"family": "Middelboe", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nybroe", "given": "Ole", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-04-00", "journal": {"volume": "80", "issn": "1574-6941", "issue": "1", "pages": "168-178", "title": "FEMS Microbiol.

However, the relationship between DNA methylation and prognostic markers, such as the proliferation gene expression signature, has not been investigated in MCL. We applied high-resolution methylation microarrays (27,578 CpG sites) to assess the global DNA methylation profiles in 20 MCL (10 each with high/low proliferation signature) and 30 CLL (15 poor-prognostic IGHV unmutated subset #1 and 15 good-prognostic IGHV mutated subset #4) samples.

After unsupervised hierarchical clustering, 17/20 MCL cases formed a cluster separate from CLL, while CLL subsets #1 and #4 formed subclusters. Surprisingly, few differentially methylated genes (n = 6) were identified between high vs. low proliferation MCL. In contrast, distinct methylation profiles were demonstrated for MCL and CLL. Importantly, certain functional classes of genes were preferentially methylated in either disease. For instance, developmental genes, in particular homeobox transcription factor genes (e.g., HLXB9, HOXA13), were more highly methylated in MCL, whereas apoptosis-related genes were enriched among targets methylated in CLL (e.g., CYFIP2, NR4A1). Results were validated using pyrosequencing, RQ-PCR and reexpression of specific genes.

coronary heart disease. Blockade of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) with a monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) licensed for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis reduces systemic and articular inflammation. However, whether IL6R blockade also reduces risk of coronary heart disease is unknown.\n\nApplying the mendelian randomisation principle, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene IL6R to evaluate the likely efficacy and safety of IL6R inhibition for primary prevention of coronary heart disease. We compared genetic findings with the effects of tocilizumab reported in randomised trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn 40 studies including up to 133,449 individuals, an IL6R SNP (rs7529229) marking a non-synonymous IL6R variant (rs8192284; p.Asp358Ala) was associated with increased circulating log interleukin-6 concentration (increase per allele 9\u00b745%, 95% CI 8\u00b734-10\u00b757) as well as reduced C-reactive protein (decrease per allele 8\u00b735%, 95% CI 7\u00b731-9\u00b738) and fibrinogen concentrations (decrease per allele 0\u00b785%, 95% CI 0\u00b760-1\u00b710). This pattern of effects was consistent with IL6R blockade from infusions of tocilizumab (4-8 mg/kg every 4 weeks) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis studied in randomised trials. In 25,458 coronary heart disease cases and 100,740 controls, the IL6R rs7529229 SNP was associated with a decreased odds of coronary heart disease events (per allele odds ratio 0\u00b795, 95% CI 0\u00b793-0\u00b797, p=1\u00b753\u00d710(-5)).\n\nOn the basis of genetic evidence in human beings, IL6R signalling seems to have a causal role in development of coronary heart disease. IL6R blockade could provide a novel therapeutic approach to prevention of coronary heart disease that warrants testing in suitably powered randomised trials. Genetic studies in populations could be used more widely to help to validate and prioritise novel drug targets or to repurpose existing agents and targets for new therapeutic uses.\n\nUK Medical

proposed to contribute to various stages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades. To assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect IL6R signalling.\n\nIn a collaborative meta-analysis, we studied Asp358Ala (rs2228145) in IL6R in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants. We also compared the frequency of Asp358Ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls. To gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed Asp358Ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6.\n\nThe minor allele frequency of Asp358Ala was 39%. Asp358Ala was not associated with lipid concentrations, blood pressure, adiposity, dysglycaemia, or smoking (p value for association per minor allele \u22650\u00b704 for each). By contrast, for every copy of 358Ala inherited, mean concentration of IL6R increased by 34\u00b73% (95% CI 30\u00b74-38\u00b72) and of interleukin 6 by 14\u00b76% (10\u00b77-18\u00b74), and mean concentration of C-reactive protein was reduced by 7\u00b75% (5\u00b79-9\u00b71) and of fibrinogen by 1\u00b70% (0\u00b77-1\u00b73). For every copy of 358Ala inherited, risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 3\u00b74% (1\u00b78-5\u00b70). Asp358Ala was not related to IL6R mRNA levels or interleukin-6 production in monocytes.\n\nLarge-scale human genetic and biomarker data are consistent with a causal association between IL6R-related

We performed genome-wide association studies in up to 130,600 European ancestry participants overall, and stratified for key CKD risk factors. We uncovered 6 new loci in association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the primary clinical measure of CKD, in or near MPPED2, DDX1, SLC47A1, CDK12, CASP9, and INO80. Morpholino knockdown of mpped2 and casp9 in zebrafish embryos revealed podocyte and tubular abnormalities with altered dextran clearance, suggesting a role for these genes in renal function. By providing new insights into genes that regulate renal function, these results could further our understanding of the pathogenesis of CKD.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1002584", "pmid":

hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and other metabolic traits. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in 39,883 individuals of European ancestry to identify genes associated with metabolic disease. We identified 8 novel loci associated with adiponectin levels and confirmed 2 previously reported loci (P\u200a=\u200a4.5\u00d710(-8)-1.2\u00d710(-43)). Using a novel method to combine data across ethnicities (N\u200a=\u200a4,232 African Americans, N\u200a=\u200a1,776 Asians, and N\u200a=\u200a29,347 Europeans), we identified two additional novel loci. Expression analyses of 436 human adipocyte samples revealed that mRNA levels of 18 genes at candidate regions were associated with adiponectin concentrations after accounting for multiple testing (p<3\u00d710(-4)). We next developed a multi-SNP genotypic risk score to test the association of adiponectin decreasing risk alleles on metabolic traits and diseases using consortia-level meta-analytic data. This risk score was associated with increased risk of T2D (p\u200a=\u200a4.3\u00d710(-3), n\u200a=\u200a22,044), increased triglycerides (p\u200a=\u200a2.6\u00d710(-14), n\u200a=\u200a93,440), increased waist-to-hip ratio (p\u200a=\u200a1.8\u00d710(-5), n\u200a=\u200a77,167), increased glucose two hours post oral glucose tolerance testing (p\u200a=\u200a4.4\u00d710(-3), n\u200a=\u200a15,234), increased fasting insulin (p\u200a=\u200a0.015, n\u200a=\u200a48,238), but with lower in HDL-cholesterol concentrations (p\u200a=\u200a4.5\u00d710(-13), n\u200a=\u200a96,748) and decreased BMI (p\u200a=\u200a1.4\u00d710(-4), n\u200a=\u200a121,335).

Comparative analysis of the crystal structures of H-2K(b)/gp34 and H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 demonstrated that nitrotyrosination of p3Y in gp34 abrogates a hydrogen bond interaction formed with the H-2K(b) residue E152. As a consequence the conformation of the TCR-interacting E152 was profoundly altered in H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 when compared to H-2K(b)/gp34, thereby modifying the surface of the nitrotyrosinated MHC complex. Furthermore, nitrotyrosination of gp34 resulted in structural over-packing, straining the overall conformation and considerably reducing the stability of the H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 MHC complex when compared to H-2K(b)/gp34. Our structural analysis also indicates that nitrotyrosination of the main TCR-interacting residue p4Y in gp33 abrogates recognition of H-2D(b)/gp33-NY complexes by H-2D(b)/gp33-specific T cells through sterical hindrance.

The significant positive correlations between indices of copepod development and bacterial diversity indicate that disruption of the microflora was likely to be an important factor behind retarded juvenile development in the experimental animals. Moreover, as evidenced by ribotype distribution in the bacterial clone libraries, the exposure to antibiotics caused a shift in dominance from Betaproteobacteria to Cardinium bacteria; the latter have been shown to cause reproductive manipulations in various terrestrial arthropods.

Serial brain MRI displayed progressive, prominent cerebellar atrophy accompanied by thinning of the corpus callosum, dysmyelination, and frontal and temporal cortical atrophy.

Often considered to be genomic parasites, they can lead to dramatic changes in genome organization, gene expression, and gene evolution. The oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans has evolved a genome organization where core biology genes are predominantly located in genome regions that have relatively few resident transposons. In contrast, disease effector-encoding genes are most frequently located in rapidly evolving genomic regions that are rich in transposons. P. infestans, as a eukaryote, likely uses RNA silencing to minimize the activity of transposons. We have shown that fusion of a short interspersed element (SINE) to an effector gene in P. infestans leads to the silencing of both the introduced fusion and endogenous homologous sequences. This is also likely to occur naturally in the genome of P. infestans, as transcriptional inactivation of effectors is known to occur, and over half of the translocated \"RXLR class\" of effectors are located within 2 kb of transposon sequences in the P. infestans genome.

Of the differentially expressed genes in cortical bone, including marrow, 98% were upregulated. In contrast, hypervitaminotic cortical bone without marrow showed reduced expression of 37% of differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that only samples containing bone marrow were associated with a GO term, which principally represented extracellular matrix. This is consistent with the histological findings of increased endosteal/marrow osteoblast number. Fourteen genes, including Cyp26b1, which is known to be upregulated by vitamin A, were selected and verified by real-time PCR. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of bone sections confirmed that the bone-specific molecule osteoadherin was upregulated. Further analysis of the major gene-expression changes revealed apparent augmented Wnt signaling in the sample containing bone marrow but reduced Wnt signaling in cortical bone. Moreover, induced expression of hypoxia-associated genes was found only in samples containing bone marrow. Together, these results highlight the importance of compartment-specific analysis of bone and corroborate previous observations of compartment-specific effects of vitamin A, with reduced activity in cortical bone but increased activity in the endosteal/marrow compartment.

These PrESTs are expressed recombinantly in E. coli and they consist of a short and unique region of the protein of interest as well as purification and solubility tags.

The PrESTs are then spiked into cell lysates and the SILAC ratios of PrEST peptides to peptides from endogenous target proteins yield their cellular quantities. The procedure can readily be multiplexed, as we demonstrate by simultaneously determining the copy number of 40 proteins in HeLa cells. Among the proteins analyzed, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was found to be most abundant with 20 million copies per cell, while the transcription factor and oncogene FOS only had 6000 copies. Direct quantification of the absolute amount of single proteins is possible via a SILAC experiment in which labeled cell lysate is mixed both with the heavy labeled solubility tag and with the corresponding PrEST.

To characterize NEDD8-cullin target proteins, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of cells treated with MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway. MRFAP1 and its interaction partner, MORF4L1, were among the most up-regulated proteins after NEDD8 inhibition in multiple human cell lines. We show that MRFAP1 has a fast turnover rate in the absence of MLN4924 and is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The increased abundance of MRFAP1 after MLN4924 treatment results from a decreased rate of degradation. Characterization of the binding partners of both MRFAP1 and MORF4L1 revealed a complex protein-protein interaction network. MRFAP1 bound to a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including CUL4B, but not to components of the NuA4 complex, including MRGBP, which bound to MORF4L1. These data indicate that MRFAP1 may regulate the ability of MORF4L1 to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes by binding to MORF4L1 in a mutually exclusive manner with MRGBP. Analysis of MRFAP1 expression in human tissues by immunostaining with a MRFAP1-specific antibody revealed that it was detectable in only a small number of tissues, in particular testis and brain.

Here, we conducted a GWAS of Alzheimer disease (AD) in 2,586 Swedes and performed gene-based meta-analysis with three additional studies from France, Canada, and the United States, in total encompassing 4,259 cases and 8,284 controls.

Modern molecular methodologies, like phage display, allow for the development of specific antibodies targeting virtually any antigen, including those of CMV. However, such methodologies do not in general result in products that by themselves mediate biological activity. To facilitate a semi-high-throughput approach for functional screening in future efforts to develop efficacious antibodies against CMV, we have integrated two different approaches to circumvent potential bottlenecks in such efforts. Firstly, we explored an approach that permits easy transfer of antibody fragment encoding genes from commonly used phage display vectors into vectors for the production of divalent immunoglobulins. Secondly, we demonstrate that such proteins can be applied in a novel reporter-based neutralization assay to establish a proof-of-concept workflow for the generation of neutralizing antibodies against CMV. We validated our approach by showing that divalent antibodies raised against the antigenic domain (AD)-2 region of gB effectively neutralized three different CMV strains (AD169, Towne and TB40/E), whereas two antibodies against the AD-1 region of gB displayed minor neutralizing capabilities.

Macrophages undergo extensive transcriptional reprogramming in response to inflammatory stimuli such as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS).To identify gene transcription regulation patterns involved in early innate immune responses, we used two genome-wide approaches--gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. We examined the effect of 2 hrs LPS stimulation on early gene expression and its relation to chromatin remodeling (H3 acetylation; H3Ac) and promoter binding of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 (S5P RNAPII), which is a marker for transcriptional initiation. Our results indicate novel and alternative gene regulatory mechanisms for certain proinflammatory genes. We identified two groups of up-regulated inflammatory genes with respect to chromatin modification and promoter features. One group, including highly up-regulated genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), was characterized by H3Ac, high CpG content and lack of TATA boxes. The second group, containing inflammatory mediators (interleukins and CCL chemokines), was up-regulated upon LPS stimulation despite lacking H3Ac in their annotated promoters, which were low in CpG content but did contain TATA boxes. Genome-wide analysis showed that few H3Ac peaks were unique to either +/-LPS condition. However, within these, an unpacking/expansion of already existing H3Ac peaks was observed upon LPS stimulation. In contrast, a significant proportion of S5P RNAPII peaks (approx 40%) was unique to either condition. Furthermore, data indicated a large portion of previously unannotated TSSs, particularly in LPS-stimulated macrophages, where only 28% of unique S5P RNAPII peaks overlap annotated promoters.

Here we report the characterization of two enzymes from this pathway in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, utilizing structural biology, biochemistry and genetics. We show that tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (DapD) from P. aeruginosa is specific for the L-stereoisomer of the amino substrate L-2-aminopimelate, and its D-enantiomer acts as a weak inhibitor. The crystal structures of this enzyme with L-2-aminopimelate and D-2-aminopimelate, respectively, reveal that both compounds bind at the same site of the enzyme. Comparison of the binding interactions of these ligands in the enzyme active site suggests misalignment of the amino group of D-2-aminopimelate for nucleophilic attack on the succinate moiety of the co-substrate succinyl-CoA as the structural basis of specificity and inhibition.

We conducted a meta-analysis of five European family-based genome-wide association studies (N\u200a=\u200a4034) on plasma levels of 24 sphingomyelins (SPM), 9 ceramides (CER), 57 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 20 lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), 27 phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and 16 PE-based plasmalogens (PLPE), as well as their proportions in each major class.

The frequency and distribution of de novo somatic structural variants in normal cells is, however, poorly explored. Using age-stratified cohorts of 318 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 296 single-born subjects, we describe age-related accumulation of copy-number variation in the nuclear genomes in vivo and frequency changes for both megabase- and kilobase-range variants. Megabase-range aberrations were found in 3.4% (9 of 264) of subjects \u226560 years old; these subjects included 78 MZ twin pairs and 108 single-born individuals. No such findings were observed in 81 MZ pairs or 180 single-born subjects who were \u226455 years old. Recurrent region- and gene-specific mutations, mostly deletions, were observed. Longitudinal analyses of 43 subjects whose data were collected 7-19 years apart suggest considerable variation in the rate of accumulation of clones carrying structural changes. Furthermore, the longitudinal analysis of individuals with structural aberrations suggests that there is a natural self-removal of aberrant cell clones from peripheral blood. In three healthy subjects, we detected somatic aberrations characteristic of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The recurrent rearrangements uncovered here are candidates for common age-related defects in human blood cells. We anticipate that extension of these results will allow determination of the genetic age of different somatic-cell lineages and estimation of possible individual differences between genetic and chronological age.

We use black grouse as it is distributed across Europe and found in populations with varying degrees of isolation and size. We sampled 11 different populations; five continuous, three isolated, and three small and isolated. We tested patterns of genetic variation in these populations using three different types of genetic markers: nine microsatellites and 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which both were found to be neutral, and two functional MHC genes that are presumably under selection. The small isolated populations displayed significantly lower neutral genetic diversity compared to continuous populations. A similar trend, but not as pronounced, was found for genotypes at MHC class II loci. Populations were less divergent at MHC genes compared to neutral markers. Measures of genetic diversity and population genetic structure were positively correlated among microsatellites and SNPs, but none of them were correlated to MHC when comparing all populations.

The majority of CRCs, which develop from adenoma precursor lesions, show gain of chromosome arm 20q, where BCL2L1 is located. BCL2L1 is an important apoptosis regulating gene that codes for both an anti-apoptotic (Bcl-x(L)) and a pro-apoptotic (Bcl-x(S)) splice variant. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether BCL2L1 contributes to 20q gain-driven colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression. To this end, the functional role of BCL2L1 in cancer-related processes was investigated, and differences in BCL2L1 DNA, mRNA, and protein levels were compared between colorectal adenomas and CRCs, as well as between tumours with and without 20q gain. Down-modulation of BCL2L1 inhibited cell viability and anchorage-independent growth of CRC cells, while invasion was not affected. BCL2L1 DNA copy number and protein expression were increased in CRCs compared to adenomas (p = 0.00005 and p = 0.03, respectively), while mRNA expression was not. Differences in BCL2L1 protein expression were even more pronounced between tumours with and without 20q gain (p = 0.0001). In conclusion, BCL2L1 is functionally involved in several cancer-related processes and its protein expression is associated with 20q gain. This supports a role for 20q gain-dependent expression of BCL2L1 in colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression. However, the absence of a direct correlation between BCL2L1 mRNA and protein expression implies that BCL2L1 protein expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by a distinct factor on the 20q amplicon (eg ZNF217, AURKA or miRNAs). Therefore, even though BCL2L1 affects CRC biology in a 20q gain-dependent manner, it is not likely to be a driver of chromosome 20q gain associated adenoma-to-carcinoma progression.", "doi": "10.1002/path.2983", "pmid": "22009326", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a9b4a8bb765945cb93d750e492d52952.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a9b4a8bb765945cb93d750e492d52952"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fd27b826e237424b8522a24356fd977a", "title": "Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema.", "authors": [{"family": "Abrahamsson", "given": "Thomas R", "initials": "TR"}, {"family": "Jakobsson", "given": "Hedvig E", "initials": "HE"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n", "given": "Bengt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Engstrand", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Jenmalm", "given": "Maria C", "initials": "MC"}], "type": "controlled clinical trial", "published": "2012-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "129", "issn": "1097-6825", "issue": "2", "pages": "434-40, 440.e1-2", "title": "J.

However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions. The noise will appear in the form of a background distribution of reads that must be taken into account in the downstream analysis, for example when detecting enriched regions (peak-calling). Several reported peak-callers can take experimental measurements of background tag distribution into account when analysing a data set. Unfortunately, the background is only used to adjust peak calling and not as a pre-processing step that aims at discerning the signal from the background noise. A normalization procedure that extracts the signal of interest would be of universal use when investigating genomic patterns.\n\nWe formulated such a normalization method based on linear regression and made a proof-of-concept implementation in R and C++. It was tested on simulated as well as on publicly available ChIP-seq data on binding sites for two transcription factors, MAX and FOXA1 and two control samples, Input and IgG. We applied three different peak-callers to (i) raw (un-normalized) data using statistical background models and (ii) raw data with control samples as background and (iii) normalized data without additional control samples as background. The fraction of called regions containing the expected transcription factor binding motif was largest for the normalized data and evaluation with qPCR data for FOXA1 suggested higher sensitivity and specificity using normalized data over raw data with experimental background.\n\nThe proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously.

Mol. Genet."}, "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BPD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by various life-crippling symptoms and high suicide rates. Multiple studies support a strong genetic involvement in the etiology of these disorders, although patterns of inheritance are variable and complex. Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a cellular mechanism, which has been implicated in mental disorders and suicide. To examine the involvement of altered RNA editing in these disorders, we: (i) quantified the mRNA levels of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing enzymes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and (ii) measured the editing levels in transcripts of several neuroreceptors using 454 high-throughput sequencing, in dorsolateral-prefrontal cortices of schizophrenics, BPD patients and controls. Increased expression of specific ADAR2 variants with diminished catalytic activity was observed in schizophrenia. Our results also indicate that the I/V editing site in the glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2 (GRIK2) transcript is under-edited in BPD (type I) patients (45.8 versus 53.9%, P= 0.023). GRIK2 has been implicated in mood disorders, and editing of its I/V site can modulate Ca(+2) permeability of the channel, consistent with numerous observations of elevated intracellular Ca(+2) levels in BPD patients. Our findings may therefore, at least partly, explain a molecular mechanism underlying the disorder. In addition, an intriguing correlation was found between editing events on separate exons of GRIK2. Finally, multiple novel editing sites were detected near previously known sites, albeit most with very low editing rates. This supports the hypothesis raised previously regarding the existence of wide-spread low-level 'background' editing as a mechanism that enhances adaptation and evolvability.", "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddr461", "pmid": "21984433", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ddr461"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4e29f3d9ea9a44c1bc81f0adee660b0b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/4e29f3d9ea9a44c1bc81f0adee660b0b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a424339a9d0e407da321b590561dbb24", "title": "Long-range DNA looping and gene expression analyses identify DEXI as an autoimmune disease candidate gene.", "authors": [{"family": "Davison", "given": "Lucy J", "initials": "LJ"}, {"family": "Wallace", "given": "Chris", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Cooper", "given": "Jason D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Cope", "given": "Nathan F", "initials": "NF"}, {"family": "Wilson", "given": "Nicola K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Smyth", "given": "Deborah J", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Howson", "given": "Joanna M M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Saleh", "given": "Nada", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Al-Jeffery", "given": "Abdullah", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Angus", "given": "Karen L", "initials": "KL"}, {"family": "Stevens", "given": "Helen E", "initials": "HE"}, {"family": "Nutland", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Duley", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Coulson", "given": "Richard M R", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Walker", "given": "Neil M", "initials": "NM"}, {"family": "Burren", "given": "Oliver S", "initials": "OS"}, {"family": "Rice", "given": "Catherine M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Cambien", "given": "Francois", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Zeller", "given": "Tanja", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Munzel", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lackner", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Blakenberg", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cardiogenics Consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}, {"family": "Fraser", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Gottgens", "given": "Berthold", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Todd", "given": "John A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Attwood", "given": "Tony", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Belz", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Braund", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Cambien", "given": "Fran\u00e7ois", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Cooper", "given": "Jason", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Crisp-Hihn", "given": "Abi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Diemert", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Deloukas", "given": "Panos", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Foad", "given": "Nicola", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Erdmann", "given": "Jeanette", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Goodall", "given": "Alison H", "initials": "AH"}, {"family": "Gracey", "given": "Jay", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Gray", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Williams", "given": "Rhian G", "initials": "RG"}, {"family": "Heimerl", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hengstenberg", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Jolley", "given": "Jennifer", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Krishnan", "given": "Unni", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Lloyd-Jones", "given": "Heather", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lugauer", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Lundmark", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Maouche", "given": "Seraya", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Moore", "given": "Jasbir S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Muir", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Murray", "given": "Elizabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Nelson", "given": "Chris P", "initials": "CP"}, {"family": "Neudert", "given": "Jessica", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Niblett", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "O'Leary", "given": "Karen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Ouwehand", "given": "Willem H", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Pollard", "given": "Helen", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Rankin", "given": "Angela", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sager", "given": "Hendrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Samani", "given": "Nilesh J", "initials": "NJ"}, {"family": "Sambrook", "given": "Jennifer", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schmitz", "given": "Gerd", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Scholz", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schroeder", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Schunkert", "given": "Heribert", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Syvannen", "given": "Ann-Christine", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Tennstedt", "given": "Stefanie", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-15", "journal": {"volume": "21", "issn": "1460-2083", "issue": "2", "pages": "322-333", "title": "Hum. Mol. Genet."}, "abstract": "The chromosome 16p13 region has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple sclerosis (MS). CLEC16A has been reported as the most likely candidate gene in the region, since it contains the most disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as an imunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. However, here we report that intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing the most autoimmune disease-associated SNPs, appears to behave as a regulatory sequence, affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene, DEXI. The CLEC16A alleles that are protective from T1D and MS are associated with increased expression of DEXI, and no other genes in the region, in two independent monocyte gene expression data sets. Critically, using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identified physical proximity between the DEXI promoter region and intron 19 of CLEC16A, separated by a loop of >150 kb. In reciprocal experiments, a 20 kb fragment of intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing SNPs associated with T1D and MS, as well as with DEXI expression, interacted with the promotor region of DEXI but not with candidate DNA fragments containing other potential causal genes in the region, including CLEC16A. Intron 19 of CLEC16A is highly enriched for transcription-factor-binding events and markers associated with enhancer activity. Taken together, these data indicate that although the causal variants in the 16p13 region lie within CLEC16A, DEXI is an unappreciated autoimmune disease candidate gene, and illustrate the power of the 3C approach in progressing from genome-wide association studies results to candidate causal genes.", "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddr468", "pmid": "21989056", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ddr468"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3276289"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a424339a9d0e407da321b590561dbb24.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a424339a9d0e407da321b590561dbb24"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "758b525b3955477e8f58d7cc2c603d38", "title": "Structural genetic variation in the context of somatic mosaicism.", "authors": [{"family": "Dumanski", "given": "Jan P", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Piotrowski", "given": "Arkadiusz", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-10", "journal": {"volume": "838", "issn": "1940-6029", "issue": null, "pages": "249-272", "title": "Methods Mol.

Structural genetic variation is a very heterogeneous group of changes, in terms of numerous types of aberrations that are included in this category, involvement of many mechanisms behind the generation of structural variants, and because structural variation can encompass genomic regions highly variable in size. Structural variation rapidly evolved as the dominating type of changes behind human genetic diversity, and the importance of this variation in biology and medicine is continuously increasing. In this review, we combine the evidence of structural variation in the context of somatic cells. We discuss the normal and disease-related somatic structural variation. We review the recent advances in the field of monozygotic twins and other models that have been studied for somatic mutations, including other vertebrates. We also discuss chromosomal mosaicism in a few prime examples of disease genes that contributed to understanding of the importance of somatic heterogeneity. We further highlight challenges and opportunities related to this field, including methodological and practical aspects of detection of somatic mosaicism. The literature devoted to interindividual variation versus papers reporting on somatic variation suggests that the latter is understudied and underestimated. It is important to increase our awareness about somatic mosaicism, in particular, related to structural variation. We believe that further research of somatic mosaicism will prove beneficial for better understanding of common sporadic disorders.", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-61779-507-7_12", "pmid": "22228016", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/758b525b3955477e8f58d7cc2c603d38.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/758b525b3955477e8f58d7cc2c603d38"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b0c9cd20e86541bcbd1cc2c3211c019d", "title": "Differential expression patterns of conserved miRNAs and isomiRs during Atlantic halibut development.", "authors": [{"family": "Bizuayehu", "given": "Teshome T", "initials": "TT"}, {"family": "Lanes", "given": "Carlos F C", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Furmanek", "given": "Tomasz", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Karlsen", "given": "B\u00e5rd O", "initials": "BO"}, {"family": "Fernandes", "given": "Jorge M O", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Johansen", "given": "Steinar D", "initials": "SD"}, {"family": "Babiak", "given": "Igor", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-10", "journal": {"volume": "13", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": null, "pages": "11", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a major role in animal ontogenesis.

We revealed that nucleotide truncations and/or additions at the 3' end of mature miRNAs resulted in size variants showing differential expression patterns during the development in a number of miRNA families.

The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with T2DM in the African American population. We performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using the Affymetrix 6.0 array in 965 African-American cases with T2DM and end-stage renal disease (T2DM-ESRD) and 1029 population-based controls. The most significant SNPs (n\u200a=\u200a550 independent loci) were genotyped in a replication cohort and 122 SNPs (n\u200a=\u200a98 independent loci) were further tested through genotyping three additional validation cohorts followed by meta-analysis in all five cohorts totaling 3,132 cases and 3,317 controls. Twelve SNPs had evidence of association in the GWAS (P<0.0071), were directionally consistent in the Replication cohort and were associated with T2DM in subjects without nephropathy (P<0.05). Meta-analysis in all cases and controls revealed a single SNP reaching genome-wide significance (P<2.5\u00d710(-8)). SNP rs7560163 (P\u200a=\u200a7.0\u00d710(-9), OR (95% CI)\u200a=\u200a0.75 (0.67-0.84)) is located intergenically between RND3 and RBM43. Four additional loci (rs7542900, rs4659485, rs2722769 and rs7107217) were associated with T2DM (P<0.05) and reached more nominal levels of significance (P<2.5\u00d710(-5)) in the overall analysis and may represent novel loci that contribute to T2DM. We have identified novel T2DM-susceptibility variants in the African-American population. Notably, T2DM risk was associated with the major allele and implies an interesting genetic architecture in this population. These results suggest that multiple loci underlie T2DM susceptibility in the African-American population and that these loci are distinct from those identified in other ethnic populations.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0029202", "pmid": "22238593", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-11-17050"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3251563"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9ba3e0d7fbbe42d39db7c4cd21315b59.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9ba3e0d7fbbe42d39db7c4cd21315b59"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a95d3f8a7bd640d0814032bf7ddf636d", "title": "siRNA silencing of proteasome maturation protein (POMP) activates the unfolded protein response and constitutes a model for KLICK genodermatosis.", "authors": [{"family": "Dahlqvist", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "T\u00f6rm\u00e4", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Badhai", "given": "Jitendra", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Dahl", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-03", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "1", "pages": "e29471", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Keratosis linearis with ichthyosis congenita and keratoderma (KLICK) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder associated with a single-nucleotide deletion in the 5'untranslated region of the proteasome maturation protein (POMP) gene. The deletion causes a relative switch in transcription start sites for POMP, predicted to decrease levels of POMP protein in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. To investigate the pathophysiology behind KLICK we created an in vitro model of the disease using siRNA silencing of POMP in epidermal air-liquid cultures. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue constructs revealed aberrant staining of POMP, proteasome subunits and the skin differentiation marker filaggrin when compared to control tissue constructs. The staining patterns of POMP siRNA tissue constructs showed strong resemblance to those observed in skin biopsies from KLICK patients. Western blot analysis of lysates from the organotypic tissue constructs revealed an aberrant processing of profilaggrin to filaggrin in samples transfected with siRNA against POMP. Knock-down of POMP expression in regular cell cultures resulted in decreased amounts of proteasome subunits. Prolonged silencing of POMP in cultured cells induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression consistent with an activation of the unfolded protein response and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined results indicate that KLICK is caused by reduced levels of POMP, leading to proteasome insufficiency in differentiating keratinocytes. Proteasome insufficiency disturbs terminal epidermal differentiation, presumably by increased ER stress, and leads to perturbed processing of profilaggrin. Our findings underline a critical role for the proteasome in human epidermal differentiation.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0029471", "pmid": "22235297", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-11-09470"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3250448"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a95d3f8a7bd640d0814032bf7ddf636d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a95d3f8a7bd640d0814032bf7ddf636d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d373e71c06094217863b00c08b3b5ee2", "title": "Lymphoblastoid cell line with B1 cell characteristics established from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia clone by in vitro EBV infection.", "authors": [{"family": "Ros\u00e9n", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bergh", "given": "Ann-Charlotte", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Gogok", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Evaldsson", "given": "Chamilly", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Myhrinder", "given": "Anna Lanemo", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Hellqvist", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rasul", "given": "Abu", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkholm", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jansson", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mansouri", "given": "Larry", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "Anquan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Teh", "given": "Bin Tean", "initials": "BT"}, {"family": "Rosenquist", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Klein", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-01", "journal": {"volume": "1", "issn": "2162-4011", "issue": "1", "pages": "18-27", "title": "Oncoimmunology"}, "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can be infected in vitro. Infected cells do not express the growth-promoting set of EBV-encoded genes and therefore they do not yield LCLs, in most experiments. With exceptional clones, lines were obtained however. We describe a new line, HG3, established by in vitro EBV-infection from an IGHV1-2 unmutated CLL patient clone. All cells expressed EBNA-2 and LMP-1, the EBV-encoded genes pivotal for transformation. The karyotype, FISH cytogenetics and SNP-array profile of the line and the patient's ex vivo clone showed biallelic 13q14 deletions with genomic loss of DLEU7, miR15a/miR16-1, the two micro-RNAs that are deleted in 50% of CLL cases. Further features of CLL cells were: expression of CD5/CD20/CD27/CD43 and release of IgM natural antibodies reacting with oxLDL-like epitopes on apoptotic cells (cf. stereotyped subset-1). Comparison with two LCLs established from normal B cells showed 32 genes expressed at higher levels (> 2-fold). Among these were LHX2 and LILRA. These genes may play a role in the development of the disease. LHX2 expression was shown in self-renewing multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, and LILRA4 codes for a receptor for bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 that contributes to B cell development.

Long-distance migrants typically have longer wings than short-distance migrants and sedentary species, and long-winged species also tend to be more dispersive. Although the substantial heritability of avian wing length is well established, the identification of causal genes has remained elusive. Based on large-scale genotyping of 1404 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a captive population of 1067 zebra finches, we here show that the within-population variation of relative wing length (h(2) = 0.74 \u00b1 0.05) is associated with standing genetic variation in at least six genomic regions (one genome-wide significant and five suggestive). The variance explained by these six quantitative trait loci (QTL) sums to 36.8% of the phenotypic variance (half of the additive genetic variance), although this likely is an overestimate attributable to the Beavis effect. As avian wing length is primarily determined by the length of the primary feathers, we then searched for candidate genes that are related to feather growth. Interestingly, all of the QTL signals co-locate with Wnt growth factors and closely interacting genes (Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt6, Wnt7a, Wnt9a, RhoU and RhoV). Our findings therefore suggest that standing genetic variation in the Wnt genes might be linked to avian wing morphology, although there are many other genes that also fall within the confidence regions.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05365.x", "pmid": "22111790", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3254c495191d4eb6a408bc2f88e9c98b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3254c495191d4eb6a408bc2f88e9c98b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5debdccd950549b0a5d75b2a49c85939", "title": "Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase polymorphisms: relevance for kynurenic acid synthesis in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.", "authors": [{"family": "Holtze", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Saetre", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Engberg", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Schwieler", "given": "Lilly", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Werge", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Andreassen", "given": "Ole A", "initials": "OA"}, {"family": "Hall", "given": "H\u00e5kan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Terenius", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Agartz", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "J\u00f6nsson", "given": "Erik G", "initials": "EG"}, {"family": "Schalling", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Erhardt", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2012-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "37", "issn": "1488-2434", "issue": "1", "pages": "53-57", "title": "J Psychiatry Neurosci"}, "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia show increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA).

If ornament expression is influenced by general condition and condition is under polygenic control, selection will be inefficient in removing genetic variation. Here we analyze whether the genetic architecture of beak color in a population of zebra finches supports this hypothesis. Zebra finch beak color is commonly assumed to be under strong selection by mate choice, although some of the evidence is ambiguous. We show that beak redness has a heritability of 34% in our population and that it is strongly genetically correlated between the sexes, suggesting that it is largely controlled by the same genes in males and females. We mapped variation in beak redness based on 1404 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers genotyped in a large pedigree. We find evidence for linkage on four chromosomes (Tgu1, Tgu5, Tgu13, Tgu21), which together explain a large part of the additive genetic variance.

However, their abundance and taxonomic identities remain largely unknown. We used a combination of single-cell and metagenomic DNA sequencing to study the predominant photoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs inhabiting the euphotic zone of temperate, physicochemically diverse freshwater lakes. Multi-locus sequencing of 712 single amplified genomes, generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and whole genome multiple displacement amplification, showed that most of the cosmopolitan freshwater clusters contain photoheterotrophs. These comprised at least 10-23% of bacterioplankton, and RBs were the dominant fraction. Our data demonstrate that Actinobacteria, including clusters acI, Luna and acSTL, are the predominant freshwater RBs. We significantly broaden the known taxonomic range of freshwater RBs, to include Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Sphingobacteria. By sequencing single cells, we found evidence for inter-phyla horizontal gene transfer and recombination of rhodopsin genes and identified specific taxonomic groups involved in these evolutionary processes. Our data suggest that members of the ubiquitous betaproteobacteria Polynucleobacter spp. are the dominant AAPs in temperate freshwater lakes. Furthermore, the RuBisCO (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) gene was found in several single cells of Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that chemoautotrophs may be more prevalent among aerobic bacterioplankton than previously thought.
