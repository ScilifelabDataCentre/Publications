We showed previously that effective inhibition requires formation of a morphologically intact fibroblast monolayer before seeding of the tumor cells.

We find that inhibition is due to two different sets of molecules: (i) the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other surface proteins of the fibroblasts, which are responsible for contact-dependent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation; and (ii) soluble factors secreted by fibroblasts when confronted with tumor cells (confronted conditioned media, CCM) contribute to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and motility. However, conditioned media (CM) obtained from fibroblasts alone (nonconfronted conditioned media, NCM) did not inhibit tumor cell proliferation and motility. In addition, quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) data show up-regulation of proinflammatory genes.

As a consequence of dealing with viral diseases in general, there are concerns related to the emergence of drug resistant strains which calls for development of inhibitors with an alternative binding-mode than the existing highly optimized ones. We have previously reported on the use of phenylglycine as an alternative P2 residue in HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Herein, we present the synthesis, structure-activity relationships and in vitro pharmacokinetic characterization of a diverse series of linear and macrocyclic P2 pyrimidinyloxyphenylglycine based inhibitors. With access to vinyl substituents in P3, P2 and P1' positions an initial probing of macrocyclization between different positions, using ring-closing metathesis (RCM) could be performed, after addressing some synthetic challenges. Biochemical results from the wild type enzyme and drug resistant variants (e.g., R155 K) indicate that P3-P1' macrocyclization, leaving the P2 substituent in a flexible mode, is a promising approach. Additionally, the study demonstrates that phenylglycine based inhibitors benefit from p-phenylpyrimidinyloxy and m-vinyl groups as well as from the combination with an aromatic P1 motif with alkenylic P1' elongations. In fact, linear P2-P1' spanning intermediate compounds based on these fragments were found to display promising inhibitory potencies and drug like properties.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2014.10.010", "pmid": "25456385", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0968-0896(14)00723-8"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2932dd4094624af090cc607dab6a05f7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2932dd4094624af090cc607dab6a05f7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b218275a64d448cdbc636e6643df2514", "title": "Both Lewis and secretor status mediate susceptibility to rotavirus infections in a rotavirus genotype-dependent manner.", "authors": [{"family": "Nordgren", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sharma", "given": "Sumit", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bucardo", "given": "Filemon", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Nasir", "given": "Waqas", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "G\u00fcnayd\u0131n", "given": "G\u00f6k\u00e7e", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ouermi", "given": "Djeneba", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Nitiema", "given": "Leon W", "initials": "LW"}, {"family": "Becker-Dreps", "given": "Sylvia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Simpore", "given": "Jacques", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Larson", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-12-01", "journal": {"volume": "59", "issn": "1537-6591", "issue": "11", "pages": "1567-1573", "title": "Clin.

The diversity of HBGA phenotypes in different ethnic populations, combined with prevalence/absence of specific RV genotypes, led us to hypothesize whether the genetic variations in HBGAs in a population limit susceptibility to certain RV genotypes, plausibly leading to reduced vaccine efficacy.\n\nAssociation between HBGAs status and susceptibility to RV P genotypes was investigated in children in Burkina Faso and Nicaragua.

The results from Nicaragua confirmed that all P[8]-infected children (n = 22) were secretor Lewis positive.\n\nAs VP4 of genotype P[8] is a component of current RV vaccines, our finding that Lewis-negative children are resistant to P[8] strains provides a plausible explanation for the reduced vaccine efficacy in populations with a high percentage of Lewis-negative individuals, such as in Africa.

Independent analyses, including single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and pathway analysis, identified immune genes and pathways significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer. TGF\u03b2R1, which intersected all tiers of analysis and thus selected for validation, replicated significantly in the head and neck cancer GWAS limited to HPV-seropositive cases and an independent cervical cancer GWAS. The TGF\u03b2R1 containing p38-MAPK pathway was significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer, and TGF\u03b2R1 was overexpressed in oropharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, and HPV(+) head and neck cancer tumors.

MICA protein is absent from most cells but can be induced by infections and oncogenic transformation and is frequently expressed in epithelial tumors. Upon binding to MICA, NKG2D activates cytolytic responses of NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against infected and tumor cells expressing MICA. Therefore, membrane-bound MICA acts as a signal during the early immune response against infection or spontaneously arising tumors. On the other hand, human tumor cells spontaneously release a soluble form of MICA, causing the downregulation of NKG2D and in turn severe impairment of the antitumor immune response of NK and CD8(+) T cells. This is considered to promote tumor immune evasion and also to compromise host resistance to infections. MICA is the most polymorphic non-classical class I gene. A possible association of MICA polymorphism with genetic predisposition to different cancer types has been investigated in candidate gene-based studies. Two genome-wide association studies have identified loci in MICA that influence susceptibility to cervical neoplasia and hepatitis C virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Given the current level of interest in the field of MICA gene, we discuss the genetics and biology of the MICA gene and the role of its polymorphism in cancer.

The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of a novel allosteric MEK inhibitor RO4987655 in K-ras-mutated human tumor xenograft models using [(18)F] FDG-PET imaging and proteomics technology.\n\n[(18)F] FDG uptake was studied in human lung carcinoma xenografts from day 0 to day 9 of RO4987655 therapy using microPET Focus 120 (CTI Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN, USA). The expression levels of GLUT1 and hexokinase 1 were examined using semi-quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry (fIHC). The in vivo effects of RO4987655 on MAPK/PI3K pathway components were assessed by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA).\n\nWe have observed modest metabolic decreases in tumor [(18)F] FDG uptake after MEK inhibition by RO4987655 as early as 2\u00a0h post-treatment. The greatest [(18)F] FDG decreases were found on day 1, followed by a rebound in [(18)F] FDG uptake on day 3 in parallel with decreasing tumor volumes. Molecular analysis of the tumors by fIHC did not reveal statistically significant correlations of GLUT1 and hexokinase 1 expressions with the [(18)F] FDG changes. RPPA signaling response profiling revealed not only down-regulation of pERK1/2, pMKK4, and pmTOR on day 1 after RO4987655 treatment but also significant up-regulation of pMEK1/2, pMEK2, pC-RAF, and pAKT on day 3. The up-regulation of these markers is interpreted to be indicative of a reactivation of the MAPK and activation of the compensatory PI3K pathway, which can also explain the rebound in [(18)F] FDG uptake following MEK inhibition with RO4987655 in the K-ras-mutated human tumor xenografts.\n\nWe have performed the first preclinical evaluation of a new MEK inhibitor, RO4987655, using a combination of [(18)F] FDG-PET imaging and molecular proteomics.

Finally, two sequences from one putative RGR opsin similar to Sp-opsin 7 were also detected. Adult arm transcriptome analysis pinpointed opsin mRNAs corresponding to one r-opsin, one neuropsin and the homologue of Sp-opsin 2.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified several susceptibility loci for cervical cancer, but they explain only a small fraction of cervical cancer heritability. Other variants with weaker effect may be missed due to the stringent significance threshold. To identify important pathways in cervical carcinogenesis, we performed a two-stage pathway analysis in two independent GWASs in the Swedish population, using the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ratio test. The 565 predefined pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and BioCarta databases were systematically evaluated in the discovery stage (1034 cases and 3948 controls with 632,668 SNPs) and the suggestive pathways were further validated in the replication stage (616 cases and 506 controls with 341,358 SNPs). We found 12 pathways that were significant in both stages, and these were further validated using set-based analysis. For 10 of these pathways, the effect was mainly due to genetic variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. In addition, we identified a set of novel candidate genes outside the MHC region in the pathways denoted 'Staphylococcus aureus infection' and 'herpes simplex infection' that influenced susceptibility to cervical cancer (empirical P = 4.99 \u00d7 10(-5) and 4.99 \u00d7 10(-5) in the discovery study; empirical P = 8.98 \u00d7 10(-5) and 0.009 in the replication study, respectively).

Altered CLDN expression patterns have been demonstrated in numerous cancer types and lineage-specific CLDNs have been proposed as therapy targets. The objective of this study was to assess which fraction of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) express CLDN6 and CLDN18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2). Protein expression of CLDN6 and CLDN18.2 was examined by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray (n\u2009=\u2009355) and transcript levels were supportively determined based on gene expression microarray data from fresh-frozen NSCLC tissues (n\u2009=\u2009196). Both were analyzed with regard to frequency, distribution and association with clinical parameters. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections revealed distinct membranous positivity of CLDN6 (6.5%) and CLDN18.2 (3.7%) proteins in virtually non-overlapping subgroups of adenocarcinomas and large-cell carcinomas. Pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells were consistently negative. Corresponding to the protein expression, in subsets of non-squamous lung carcinoma high mRNA levels of CLDN6 (7-16%) and total CLDN18 (5-12%) were observed. Protein expression correlated well with total mRNA expression of the corresponding gene (rho\u2009=\u20090.4-0.8). CLDN18.2 positive tumors were enriched among slowly proliferating, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)-negative adenocarcinomas, suggesting that isoform-specific CLDN expression may delineate a specific subtype. Noteworthy, high CLDN6 protein expression was associated with worse prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma in the univariate [hazard ratio (HR): 1.8; p\u2009=\u20090.03] and multivariate COX regression model (HR: 1.9; p\u2009=\u20090.02).

Here, we employed PTAA and 3 structurally related chemically defined luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) to stain brain tissue sections from mice inoculated with 2 distinct prion strains. Our results showed that in addition to emission spectra, excitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) can fruitfully be assessed for optical distinction of PrP deposits associated with distinct prion strains. Our findings support the theory that alterations in LCP/LCO fluorescence are due to distinct conformational restriction of the thiophene backbone upon interaction with PrP aggregates associated with distinct prion strains.

Of the 932 isolates, 183 different PFGE types were identified, of which 83 were each represented by only one isolate. In all, 483 serovar 1/2a isolates were distributed over 114 PFGE types; 90 serovar 1/2b isolates gave 32 PFGE types; 21 serovar 1/2c isolates gave nine PFGE types; three serovar 3b isolates gave one PFGE type; and, 335 serovar 4b isolates gave 31 PFGE types. During the 1980s in Sweden, several serovar 4b cases were associated with the consumption of European raw soft cheese. However, as cheese-production hygiene has improved, the number of 4b cases has decreased. Since 1996, serovar 1/2a has been the dominant L. monocytogenes serovar in human listeriosis in Sweden. Therefore, based on current serovars and PFGE types, an association between human cases of listeriosis and the consumption of vacuum-packed gravad and cold-smoked salmon is suggested.", "doi": "10.1017/S0950268813003385", "pmid": "24480252", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0950268813003385"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6823566564914c799633d71fcba88e93.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6823566564914c799633d71fcba88e93"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9b8a235e5dbf47648b747e04e2210661", "title": "Defining the human gallbladder proteome by transcriptomics and affinity proteomics.", "authors": [{"family": "Kampf", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mardinoglu", "given": "Adil", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Fagerberg", "given": "Linn", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hallstr\u00f6m", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Danielsson", "given": "Angelika", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1615-9861", "issue": "21-22", "pages": "2498-2507", "title": "Proteomics"}, "abstract": "Global protein analysis of human gallbladder tissue is vital for identification of molecular regulators and effectors of its physiological activity. Here, we employed a genome-wide deep RNA sequencing analysis in 28 human tissues to identify the genes overrepresented in the gallbladder and complemented it with antibody-based immunohistochemistry in 48 human tissues. We characterized human gallbladder proteins and identified 140 gallbladder-specific proteins with an elevated expression in the gallbladder as compared to the other analyzed tissues. Five genes were categorized as enriched, with at least fivefold higher levels in gallbladder, 60 genes were categorized as group enriched with elevated transcript levels in gallbladder shared with at least one other tissue and 75 genes were categorized as enhanced with higher expression than the average expression in other tissues. We explored the localization of the genes within the gallbladder through cell-type specific antibody-based protein profiling and the subcellular localization of the genes through immunofluorescent-based profiling. Finally, we revealed the biological processes and metabolic functions carried out by these genes through the use of GO, KEGG Pathway, and HMR2.0 that is compilation of the human metabolic reactions. We demonstrated the results of the combined analysis of the transcriptomics and affinity proteomics.", "doi": "10.1002/pmic.201400201", "pmid": "25175928", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null, "NGI

In gliomas, STAT3 can play tumor suppressive or oncogenic roles depending on the tumor genetic background with target genes being largely unknown.\n\nWe used chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter microarrays and deep sequencing to assess the genome-wide occupancy of phospho (p)-Stat3 and epigenetic modifications of H3K4me3 and H3ac in C6 glioma cells.

The Stat3 and histone markings data were also intersected with a set of microarray data from C6 glioma cells after inhibition of Jak2/Stat3 signaling. Subsequently, we found 284 genes characterized by p-Stat3 occupancy, activating histone marks and transcriptional changes. Novel genes were screened for their potential involvement in oncogenesis, and the most interesting hits were verified by ChIP-PCR and STAT3 knockdown in human glioma cells.\n\nNon-random association between silent genes, histone marks and p-Stat3 binding near transcription start sites was observed, consistent with its repressive role in transcriptional regulation of target genes in glioma cells with specific genetic background.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.07.010", "pmid": "25111868", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1874-9399(14)00198-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d940eb6c61cc4b4b89b657178123b6fc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d940eb6c61cc4b4b89b657178123b6fc"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dc442da430d445dc9fb4f880fea083a9", "title": "Parallel barcoding of antibodies for DNA-assisted proteomics.", "authors": [{"family": "Dezfouli", "given": "Mahya", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Vickovic", "given": "Sanja", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Iglesias", "given": "Maria Jesus", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Ahmadian", "given": "Afshin", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1615-9861", "issue": "21-22", "pages": "2432-2436", "title": "Proteomics"}, "abstract": "DNA-assisted proteomics technologies enable ultra-sensitive measurements in multiplex format using DNA-barcoded affinity reagents.

Cord blood was sampled after elective CS (n = 27) and vaginal delivery. Global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation in hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) was determined by luminometric methylation assay, and genome-wide, locus-specific DNA methylation analysis was performed by Illumina Infinium 450K (Illumina, San Diego, CA), validated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing.\n\nCD34+ cells from infants delivered by CS were globally more DNA methylated (+2%) than DNA from infants delivered vaginally (P = .02). In relation to mode of delivery, a locus-specific analysis identified 343 loci with a difference in DNA methylation of 10% or greater (P < .01). A majority of the differentially methylated loci in neonatal CD34+ cells (76%) were found to be hypermethylated after vaginal delivery. In these infants, the degree of DNA methylation in 3 loci correlated to the duration of labor. The functional relevance of differentially methylated loci involved processes such as immunoglobulin biosynthetic process, regulation of glycolysis and ketone metabolism, and regulation of the response to food.\n\nA possible interpretation is that mode of delivery affects the epigenetic state of neonatal hematopoietic stem cells.

Due to the high rate of secretion, eccrine sweating is a vital regulator of body temperature in response to thermal stress in humans; therefore, an inability to sweat (anhidrosis) results in heat intolerance that may cause impaired consciousness and death. Here, we have reported 5 members of a consanguineous family with generalized, isolated anhidrosis, but morphologically normal eccrine sweat glands. Whole-genome analysis identified the presence of a homozygous missense mutation in ITPR2, which encodes the type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R2), that was present in all affected family members. We determined that the mutation is localized within the pore forming region of InsP3R2 and abrogates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that intracellular Ca2+ release by InsP3R2 in clear cells of the sweat glands is important for eccrine sweat production. Itpr2-/- mice exhibited a marked reduction in sweat secretion, and evaluation of sweat glands from Itpr2-/- animals revealed a decrease in Ca2+ response compared with controls. Together, our data indicate that loss of InsP3R2-mediated Ca2+ release causes isolated anhidrosis in humans and suggest that specific InsP3R inhibitors have the potential to reduce sweat production in hyperhidrosis.", "doi": "10.1172/JCI70720", "pmid": "25329695", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "70720"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4347256"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ee38afb802cf41a3b90de64ccbb53f24.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ee38afb802cf41a3b90de64ccbb53f24"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eed6ddc6de85489d973742a68ea53516", "title": "Replicability and robustness of genome-wide-association studies for behavioral traits.", "authors": [{"family": "Rietveld", "given": "Cornelius A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Conley", "given": "Dalton", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Nicholas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Esko", "given": "T\u00f5nu", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Medland", "given": "Sarah E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Vinkhuyzen", "given": "Anna A E", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Jian", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Boardman", "given": "Jason D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Chabris", "given": "Christopher F", "initials": "CF"}, {"family": "Dawes", "given": "Christopher T", "initials": "CT"}, {"family": "Domingue", "given": "Benjamin W", "initials": "BW"}, {"family": "Hinds", "given": "David A", "initials": "DA"}, {"family": "Johannesson", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kiefer", "given": "Amy K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Laibson", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Patrik K E", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Mountain", "given": "Joanna L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Oskarsson", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rostapshova", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Teumer", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tung", "given": "Joyce Y", "initials": "JY"}, {"family": "Visscher", "given": "Peter M", "initials": "PM"}, {"family": "Benjamin", "given": "Daniel J", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Cesarini", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Koellinger", "given": "Philipp D", "initials": "PD"}, {"family": "Social Science Genetics Association Consortium", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "25", "issn": "1467-9280", "issue": "11", "pages": "1975-1986", "title": "Psychol Sci"}, "abstract": "A recent genome-wide-association study of educational attainment identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose associations, despite their small effect sizes (each R (2) \u2248 0.02%), reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) in a large discovery sample and were replicated in an independent sample (p < .05).

Previous studies have suggested that patient-derived xenografts (PDXes) could be useful. However, the utility of PDXes in guiding real-time treatment decisions has only been reported in anecdotal forms. Here tumor biopsies from patients with stage III and IV metastatic malignant melanoma were transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate PDXes. 23/26 melanoma biopsies generated serially transplantable PDX models, and their histology, mutation status and expression profile resembled their corresponding patient biopsy. The potential treatment for one patient was revealed by an in vitro drug screen and treating PDXes with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. In another patient, the BRAF mutation predicted the response of both the patient and its corresponding PDXes to MAPK-targeted therapy. Importantly, in this unselected group of patients, the time from biopsy for generation of PDXes until death was significantly longer than the time required to reach the treatment phase of the PDXes.

Activation of CD137 (tumor necrosis factor receptor super family 9) promotes inflammation and disease development in murine atherosclerosis. CD137 is expressed in human atherosclerosis, but its role is largely unknown. This study uses a genetic approach to investigate CD137 in human atherosclerotic disease.

Here we have identified acetate as a nutrient present in the aging colonies that is utilized by these mutant subpopulations to support their continued growth. Proteome analysis of aging colonies showed that several proteins involved in acetate conversion and utilization were upregulated during aging. Acetate is known to be excreted during the exponential growth phase but can be imported later during the transition to stationary phase and converted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is used in multiple processes, including feeding into the TCA cycle, generating ATP via the glyoxylate shunt, as a source of acetyl groups for protein modification, and to support fatty acid biosynthesis. We showed that deletion of acs (encodes acetyl-CoA synthetase; converts acetate into acetyl-CoA) significantly reduced the accumulation of rpoB and rpoS mutant subpopulations on aging colonies. Measurement of radioactive acetate uptake showed that the rate of conversion decreased in aging wild-type colonies, was maintained at a constant level in the rpoB mutant, and significantly increased in the aging rpoS mutant. Finally, we showed that the growth of subpopulations on aging colonies was greatly enhanced if the aging colony itself was unable to utilize acetate, leaving more acetate available for mutant subpopulations to use. Accordingly, the data show that the accumulation of subpopulations of rpoB and rpoS mutants on aging colonies is supported by the availability in the aging colony of acetate, and by the ability of the

It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.", "doi": "10.1038/nature13545", "pmid": "25231870", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4185210"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "EMS58897"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ae66226a58604913ac60c3295afe4c54.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ae66226a58604913ac60c3295afe4c54"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fd9bef3e5ee64dddbfd3189231bf444a", "title": "The human skeletal muscle transcriptome: sex differences, alternative splicing, and tissue homogeneity assessed with RNA sequencing", "authors": [{"family": "Lindholm", "given": "M E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Huss", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Solnestam", "given": "B W", "initials": "BW"}, {"family": "Kjellqvist", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lundeberg", "given": "J", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sundberg", "given": "C J", "initials": "CJ"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-10-01", "journal": {"volume": "28", "issn": "0892-6638", "issue": "10", "pages": "4571-4581", "title": "The FASEB Journal"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1096/fj.14-255000", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fd9bef3e5ee64dddbfd3189231bf444a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/fd9bef3e5ee64dddbfd3189231bf444a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5310759a4cd64174b9ed67b4b8009e96", "title": "Medium from \u03b3-irradiated Escherichia coli bacteria stimulates a unique immune response in Drosophila cells.", "authors": [{"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Bo G", "initials": "BG"}, {"family": "Oldenvi", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Steiner", "given": "H\u00e5kan", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "46", "issn": "1879-0089", "issue": "2", "pages": "392-400", "title": "Dev.

Compared to traditional heat or chemical inactivation of microbes, \u03b3-irradiation likely preserves metabolic activity and antigenic features to a larger extent. We have previously shown that antimicrobial peptides are induced in Drosophila by peptidoglycan fragments secreted into the medium of exponentially growing bacterial cultures. In this study, we \u03b3-irradiated Escherichiacoli cells at a dose that halted cell division. The temporal synthesis and release of peptidoglycan fragments were followed as well as the potential of bacterial supernatants to induce immune responses in Drosophila S2 cells. We demonstrate that peptidoglycan synthesis continues for several days post irradiation and that monomeric peptidoglycan is shed into the medium. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a strong immune response against the bacterial medium. The response to medium taken directly post irradiation shows a large overlap to that of peptidoglycan. Medium from prolonged bacterial incubation does, however, stimulate a selective set of immune genes. A shift towards a stress response was instead observed with a striking induction of several heat shock proteins.

A stem cell state of BTSCs confers resistance to radiotherapy and treatment with alkylating agents. It is also a hallmark of aggressive brain tumors and is maintained by transcriptional networks that are also active in embryonic stem cells. Advances in reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have further identified genes that drive stemness. In this review, we will highlight the possible drivers of stemness in medulloblastoma and glioma, the most frequent types of primary malignant brain cancer in children and adults, respectively. Signals that drive expansion of developmentally defined neural precursor cells are also active in corresponding brain tumors. Transcriptomal subgroups of human medulloblastoma and glioma match features of NSCs but also more restricted progenitors. Lessons from genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models show that temporally and regionally defined NSCs can give rise to distinct subgroups of medulloblastoma and glioma. We will further discuss how acquisition of stem cell features may drive brain tumorigenesis from a non-NSC origin. Genetic alterations, signaling pathways, and therapy-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment can drive reprogramming networks and induce stemness in brain tumors.

Another aim was to further investigate the effect of the mutation on performance in Standardbreds, by using a within-family analysis and genotype-phenotype correlations in a larger horse material than in the previous study. We genotyped 427 Nordic trotters and 621 Standardbreds for the DMRT3 nonsense mutation and a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with it.

It is designed as a standard source of compounds for primary screening against novel biological targets, at the request of research partners. Given the general nature of the potential applications of this compound collection, the focus of the selection strategy lies on ensuring chemical stability, absence of reactive compounds, screening-compliant physicochemical properties, loose compliance to drug-likeness criteria (as drug design is a major, but not exclusive application), and maximal diversity/coverage of chemical space, aimed at providing hits for a wide spectrum of drugable targets. Finally, practical availability/cost issues cannot be avoided. The main goal of this publication is to inform potential future users of this library about its conception, sources, and characteristics. The outline of the selection procedure, notably of the filtering rules designed by a large committee of European medicinal chemists and chemoinformaticians, may be of general methodological interest for the screening/medicinal chemistry community. The selection task of 200K molecules out of a pre-filtered set of 1.4M candidates was shared by five independent European research groups, each picking a subset of 40K compounds according to their own in-house methodology and expertise. An in-depth analysis of chemical space coverage of the library serves not only to characterize the collection, but also to compare the various chemoinformatics-driven selection procedures of maximal diversity sets. Compound selections contributed by various participating groups were mapped onto general-purpose self-organizing maps (SOMs) built on the basis of marketed drugs and bioactive reference molecules. In this way, the occupancy of chemical space by the EU-OPENSCREEN library could be directly compared with distributions of known bioactives of various classes. This mapping highlights the relevance of the selection and shows how the consensus reached by merging the five different 40K selections contributes to achieve this relevance. The approach also allows one to readily identify subsets of target- or target-class-oriented compounds from the EU-OPENSCREEN library to suit the needs of the diverse range of potential users. The final EU-OPENSCREEN library, assembled by merging five independent selections of 40K compounds from various expert groups, represents an excellent example of a Europe-wide collaborative effort toward the common objective of building best-in-class European open screening platforms.", "doi": "10.1002/cmdc.201402126", "pmid": "25044981", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/91ccc301bead4bd8961955b65f248dc8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/91ccc301bead4bd8961955b65f248dc8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "927e069bd7454856acc9583c56bdef60", "title": "Evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance in SPG3A caused by homozygosity for a novel ATL1 missense mutation.", "authors": [{"family": "Khan", "given": "Tahir Naeem", "initials": "TN"}, {"family": "Klar", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Tariq", "given": "Muhammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Anjum Baig", "given": "Shehla", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Malik", "given": "Naveed Altaf", "initials": "NA"}, {"family": "Yousaf", "given": "Raja", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Baig", "given": "Shahid Mahmood", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Dahl", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "22", "issn": "1476-5438", "issue": "10", "pages": "1180-1184", "title": "Eur.

The physiological roles of two-component systems in Leptospira are largely unknown, despite identifying several dozens within their genomes. Biochemical confirmation of an operative phosphorelaying two-component system has been obtained so far only for the Hklep/Rrlep pair. It is known that hklep/rrlep knockout strains of Leptospira biflexa result in haem auxotrophy, although their de novo biosynthesis machinery remains fully functional. Haem is essential for Leptospira, but information about Hklep/Rrlep effector function(s) and target(s) is still lacking. We are now reporting a thorough molecular characterization of this system, which we rename HemK/HemR. The DNA HemR-binding motif was determined, and found within the genomes of saprophyte and pathogenic Leptospira. In this way, putative HemR-regulated genes were pinpointed, including haem catabolism-related (hmuO - haem oxygenase) and biosynthesis-related (the hemA/C/D/B/L/E/N/G operon). Specific HemR binding to these two promoters was quantified, and a dual function was observed in vivo, inversely repressing the hmuO, while activating the hemA operon transcription. The crystal structure of HemR receiver domain was determined, leading to a mechanistic model for its dual regulatory role.", "doi": "10.1111/mmi.12763", "pmid": "25145397", "labels": {"Karolinska High Throughput Center (KHTC)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c395acd664b54724903e9e5bea473551.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c395acd664b54724903e9e5bea473551"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eac6fedb132d4017bffa10d647a3eabf", "title": "Analyses of historical and current populations of black grouse in Central Europe reveal strong effects of genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity", "authors": [{"family": "Segelbacher", "given": "Gernot", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Strand", "given": "Tanja M", "initials": "TM"}, {"family": "Quintela", "given": "Mar\u00eda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Axelsson", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Jansman", "given": "Hugh A H", "initials": "HAH"}, {"family": "Koelewijn", "given": "Hans Peter", "initials": "HP"}, {"family": "H\u00f6glund", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1566-0621", "issue": "5", "pages": "1183-1195", "title": "Conserv Genet"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10592-014-0610-3", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/eac6fedb132d4017bffa10d647a3eabf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/eac6fedb132d4017bffa10d647a3eabf"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3d54e635428843f88583a53aadc87c66", "title": "Human cytomegalovirus tegument protein pp65 is detected in all intra- and extra-axial brain tumours independent of the tumour type or grade.", "authors": [{"family": "Libard", "given": "Sylwia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Popova", "given": "Svetlana N", "initials": "SN"}, {"family": "Amini", "given": "Rose-Marie", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "K\u00e4rj\u00e4", "given": "Vesa", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Pietil\u00e4inen", "given": "Timo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen", "given": "Kirsi M", "initials": "KM"}, {"family": "Sundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Christer", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hesselager", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ekman", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zetterling", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smits", "given": "Anja", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Pelle", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Pfeifer", "given": "Susan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "de St\u00e5hl", "given": "Teresita Diaz", "initials": "TD"}, {"family": "Enblad", "given": "Gunilla", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Alafuzoff", "given": "Irina", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-09-30", "journal": {"volume": "9", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "9", "pages": "e108861", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been indicated being a significant oncomodulator.

We analysed the performance of commercial HCMV-antibodies applying the immunohistochemical (IHC) methods on brain sample obtained from a subject with a verified HCMV infection, on samples obtained from 14 control subjects, and on a tissue microarray block containing cores of various brain tumours. Based on these trials, we selected the best performing antibody and analysed a cohort of 417 extra- and intra-axial brain tumours such as gliomas, medulloblastomas, primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and meningiomas. HCMV protein pp65 immunoreactivity was observed in all types of tumours analysed, and the IHC expression did not depend on the patient's age, gender, tumour type, or grade. The labelling pattern observed in the tumours differed from the labelling pattern observed in the tissue with an active HCMV infection. The HCMV protein was expressed in up to 90% of all the tumours investigated. Our results are in accordance with previous reports regarding the HCMV protein expression in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas. In addition, the HCMV protein expression was seen in primary brain lymphomas, low-grade gliomas, and in meningiomas. Our results indicate that the HCMV protein pp65 expression is common in intra- and extra-axial brain tumours.

The pathogenic traits in these species, e.g., the botulinum neurotoxin and the novyi alpha toxin, are mainly linked to a large plasmidome consisting of plasmids and circular prophages. The plasmidome of C. novyi sensu lato has so far been poorly characterized. In this study we explored the genomic relationship of a wide range of strains of C. novyi sensu lato with a special focus on the dynamics of the plasmidome. Twenty-four genomes were sequenced from strains selected to represent as much as possible the genetic diversity in C. novyi sensu lato. Sixty-one plasmids were identified in these genomes and 28 of them were completed. The genomic comparisons revealed four separate lineages, which did not strictly correlate with the species designations. The plasmids were categorized into 13 different plasmid groups on the basis of their similarity and conservation of plasmid replication or partitioning genes. The plasmid groups, lineages and species were to a large extent entwined because plasmids and toxin genes had moved across the lineage boundaries. This dynamic process appears to be primarily driven by phages. We here present a comprehensive characterization of the complex species group C. novyi sensu lato, explaining the intermixed genetic properties.

The origins of mesenchymal stem cells have been the subject of considerable discussion, and current consensus holds that perivascular cells form mesenchymal stem cells in most tissues. The continuously growing mouse incisor tooth offers an excellent model to address the origin of mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells dwell in a niche at the tooth apex where they produce a variety of differentiated derivatives. Cells constituting the tooth are mostly derived from two embryonic sources: neural crest ectomesenchyme and ectodermal epithelium. It has been thought for decades that the dental mesenchymal stem cells giving rise to pulp cells and odontoblasts derive from neural crest cells after their migration in the early head and formation of ectomesenchymal tissue. Here we show that a significant population of mesenchymal stem cells during development, self-renewal and repair of a tooth are derived from peripheral nerve-associated glia. Glial cells generate multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that produce pulp cells and odontoblasts.

This can occur when oncoproteins escape degradation by the UPS because of mutations in either the oncoprotein itself or in the UPS components responsible for recognition and ubiquitylation of the oncoprotein.

HRG is produced by hepatocytes and carried to tissues via the circulation. We hypothesized that HRG's tissue distribution and turnover may be mediated by inflammatory cells. Biodistribution parameters were analyzed by injection of radiolabeled, bioactive HRG in the circulation of healthy and tumor-bearing mice. 125I-HRG was cleared rapidly from the blood and taken up in tissues of healthy and tumor-bearing mice, followed by degradation, to an increased extent in the tumor-bearing mice. Steady state levels of HRG in the circulation were unaffected by the tumor disease both in murine tumor models and in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Importantly, stromal pools of HRG, detected in human CRC microarrays, were associated with inflammatory cells. In agreement, microautoradiography identified 125I-HRG in blood vessels and on CD45-positive leukocytes in mouse tissues. Moreover, radiolabeled HRG bound in a specific, heparan sulfate-independent manner, to differentiated human monocytic U937 cells in vitro. Suppression of monocyte differentiation by systemic treatment of mice with anti-colony stimulating factor-1 neutralizing antibodies led to reduced blood clearance of radiolabeled HRG and to accumulation of endogenous HRG in the blood. Combined, our data show that mononuclear phagocytes have specific binding sites for HRG and that these cells are essential for uptake of HRG from blood and distribution of HRG in tissues. Thereby, we confirm and extend our previous report that inflammatory cells mediate the effect of HRG on tumor growth and metastatic spread.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0107483", "pmid": "25243896", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-14-06030"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4171488"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9d7fcc006aef4469a16484e9b2ad1d5a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9d7fcc006aef4469a16484e9b2ad1d5a"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0a5dbff5e2254b4da19a43ae855f86ce", "title": "Distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations in individual cancer genomes by network enrichment analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Merid", "given": "Simon Kebede", "initials": "SK"}, {"family": "Goranskaya", "given": "Daria", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Alexeyenko", "given": "Andrey", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-09-19", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1471-2105", "issue": null, "pages": "308", "title": "BMC Bioinformatics"}, "abstract": "In somatic cancer genomes, delineating genuine driver mutations against a background of multiple passenger events is a challenging task. The difficulty of determining function from sequence data and the low frequency of mutations are increasingly hindering the search for novel, less common cancer drivers. The accumulation of extensive amounts of data on somatic point and copy number alterations necessitates the development of systematic methods for driver mutation analysis.\n\nWe introduce a framework for detecting driver mutations via functional network analysis, which is applied to individual genomes and does not require pooling multiple samples. It probabilistically evaluates 1) functional network links between different mutations in the same genome and 2) links between individual mutations and known cancer pathways. In addition, it can employ correlations of mutation patterns in pairs of genes. The method was used to analyze genomic alterations in two TCGA datasets, one for glioblastoma multiforme and another for ovarian carcinoma, which were generated using different approaches to mutation profiling. The proportions of drivers among the reported de novo point mutations in these cancers were estimated to be 57.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The both sets also included extended chromosomal regions with synchronous duplications or losses of multiple genes. We identified putative copy number driver events within many such segments. Finally, we summarized seemingly disparate mutations and discovered a functional network of collagen modifications in the glioblastoma. In order to select the most efficient network for use with this method, we used a novel, ROC curve-based procedure for benchmarking different network versions by their ability to recover pathway membership.\n\nThe results of our network-based procedure were in good agreement with published gold standard sets of cancer genes and were shown to complement and expand frequency-based driver analyses. On the other hand, three sequence-based methods applied to the same data yielded poor agreement with each other and with our results. We review the difference in driver proportions discovered by different sequencing approaches and discuss the functional roles of novel driver mutations.

Cells with stem cell-like properties have been identified in tumors from a variety of origins, but to our knowledge there are yet no reports on tumor-related stem cells in the human upper respiratory tract. In the present study, we show that a tracheal mucoepidermoid tumor biopsy obtained from a 6 year-old patient contained a subpopulation of cells with morphology, clonogenicity and surface markers that overlapped with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). These cells, designated as MEi (mesenchymal stem cell-like mucoepidermoid tumor) cells, could be differentiated towards mesenchymal lineages both with and without induction, and formed spheroids in vitro. The MEi cells shared several multipotent characteristics with BM-MSCs. However, they displayed differences to BM-MSCs in growth kinectics and gene expression profiles relating to cancer pathways and tube development.

By studying a cohort of 12 unrelated families affected by NLS, we provide evidence that NLS is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations in all three genes encoding enzymes of the L-serine biosynthesis pathway. Consistent with recently reported findings, we could identify PHGDH missense mutations in three unrelated families of our cohort. Furthermore, we mapped an overlapping homozygous chromosome 9 region containing PSAT1 in four consanguineous families. This gene encodes phosphoserine aminotransferase, the enzyme for the second step in L-serine biosynthesis. We identified six families with three different missense and frameshift PSAT1 mutations fully segregating with the disease. In another family, we discovered a homozygous frameshift mutation in PSPH, the gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of L-serine biosynthesis. Interestingly, all three identified genes have been previously implicated in serine-deficiency disorders, characterized by variable neurological manifestations.

Transduction of TAZ enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in bronchial epithelial cells, whereas TAZ silencing suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells. Microarray and cell culture experiments showed that ErbB ligands (amphiregulin, epiregulin, and neuregulin 1) are downstream targets of TAZ. Our in silico analysis revealed a TAZ signature that substantiated the clinical impact of TAZ and confirmed its relationship to the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway.\n\nTAZ expression defines a clinically distinct subgroup of patients with NSCLC. ErbB ligands are suggested to mediate the effects of TAZ on lung cancer progression. Our findings emphasize the tumorigenic role of TAZ and may serve as the basis for new treatment strategies.", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3328", "pmid": "24951773", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1078-0432.CCR-13-3328"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5c4b90781c3647dda3f1f74b277f01b3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5c4b90781c3647dda3f1f74b277f01b3"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "aab88baf82cb4f46a382a588d0809a37", "title": "Metagenomics reveals that detoxification systems are underrepresented in marine bacterial communities.", "authors": [{"family": "Bengtsson-Palme", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alm Rosenblad", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Molin", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Blomberg", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-09-01", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1471-2164", "issue": null, "pages": "749", "title": "BMC Genomics"}, "abstract": "Environmental shotgun sequencing (metagenomics) provides a new way to study communities in microbial ecology. We here use sequence data from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition to investigate toxicant selection pressures revealed by the presence of detoxification genes in marine bacteria. To capture a broad range of potential toxicants we selected detoxification protein families representing systems protecting microorganisms from a variety of stressors, such as metals, organic compounds, antibiotics and oxygen radicals.\n\nUsing a bioinformatics procedure based on comparative analysis to finished bacterial genomes we found that the amount of detoxification genes present in marine microorganisms seems surprisingly small. The underrepresentation is particularly evident for toxicant transporters and proteins involved in detoxifying metals. Exceptions are enzymes involved in oxidative stress defense where peroxidase enzymes are more abundant in marine bacteria compared to bacteria in general. In contrast, catalases are almost completely absent from the open ocean environment, suggesting that peroxidases and peroxiredoxins constitute a core line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the marine milieu.\n\nWe found no indication that detoxification systems would be generally more abundant close to the coast compared to the open ocean. On the contrary, for several of the protein families that displayed a significant geographical distribution, like peroxidase, penicillin binding transpeptidase and divalent ion transport protein, the open ocean samples showed the highest abundance. Along the same lines, the abundance of most detoxification proteins did not increase with estimated pollution. The low level of detoxification systems in marine bacteria indicate that the majority of marine bacteria have a low capacity to adapt to increased pollution.

To date, a full understanding of the evolution and distribution of the PBS gene cluster in picocyanobacteria has been hampered by the scarcity of genome sequences from fresh- and brackish water-adapted strains. To remediate this, we analysed genomes assembled from metagenomic samples collected along a natural salinity gradient, and over the course of a growth season, in the Baltic Sea. We found that while PBS gene clusters in picocyanobacteria sampled in marine habitats were highly similar to known references, brackish-adapted genotypes harboured a novel type not seen in previously sequenced genomes.

Additionally, parental and progeny isolates were phenotyped using a genetic stock of wheat genotypes representing 21 resistance genes. All S1 progeny isolates had virulence for 14 out of 15 loci where the parental isolate was virulent. This was consistent with the hypothesis that virulence in plant pathogens is often recessive to avirulence, i.e., only expressed in a homozygous state. Furthermore, no segregation was observed for five out of six loci, for which the parental isolate had an avirulent phenotype.

We sequenced the transcriptome of snails of both ecotypes from three distant geographical locations (Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) and mapped the reads to the L. saxatilis reference genome. We identified genomic regions potentially under divergent selection between ecotypes within each country, using an outlier approach based on F(ST) values calculated per locus. In line with previous studies indicating that gene reuse is generally common, we expected to find extensive sharing of outlier loci due to recent shared ancestry and gene flow between at least two of the locations in our study system. Contrary to our expectations, we found that most outliers were country specific, suggesting that much of the genetic basis of divergence is not shared among locations. However, we did find that more outliers were shared than expected by chance and that differentiation of shared outliers is often generated by the same SNPs. We discuss two mechanisms potentially explaining the limited amount of sharing we observed. First, a polygenic basis of divergent traits might allow for multiple distinct molecular mechanisms generating the same phenotypic patterns.

It is now known that RNA plays highly specific roles in pathways involved in regulatory, structural, and catalytic functions. The complexity of RNA production and regulation has become evident with the advent of high-throughput methods to study the transcriptome. Deep sequencing has revealed an enormous diversity of RNA types and transcript isoforms in human cells. The transcriptome of the human brain is particularly interesting as it contains more expressed genes than other tissues and also displays an extreme diversity of transcript isoforms, indicating that highly complex regulatory pathways are present in the brain. Several of these regulatory proteins are now identified, including RNA-binding proteins that are neuron specific. RNA-binding proteins also play important roles in regulating the splicing process and the temporal and spatial isoform production. While significant progress has been made in understanding the human transcriptome, many questions still remain regarding the basic mechanisms of splicing and subcellular localization of RNA. A long-standing question is to what extent the splicing of pre-mRNA is cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional, respectively. Recent data, including studies of the human brain, indicate that splicing is primarily cotranscriptional in human cells.

However, over-reliance on one drug class is a risk factor for the development of AR. Consequently, benzimidazole resistance is widespread in several veterinary parasites, where it is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug targets encoded by the \u03b2-tubulin genes. The importance of these SNPs varies between different parasitic nematodes, but it has been hypothesised that they occur, at low allele frequencies, even in unselected populations. This study investigated whether these SNPs exist in the P. equorum population and tested the hypothesis that BZ resistance can develop from pre-existing SNPs in codons 167, 198 and 200 of the \u03b2-tubulin isotype 1 and 2 genes, reported to be associated with AR in strongylids.

Faecal egg count reduction testing of fenbendazole showed that this anthelmintic was still 100% effective, meaning that the likelihood of finding high allele frequency of SNPs associated with benzimidazoles resistance in P. equorum was low. Unexpectedly, the allele frequencies observed in single worms were comparable to those in pooled samples.\r\n\r\nWe concluded that fenbendazole does not exert selection pressure on the \u03b2-tubulin genes of isotypes 1 and 2 in P. equorum.

Biol. Chem."}, "abstract": "Acetyl-CoA plays a fundamental role in cell signaling and metabolic pathways, with its cellular levels tightly controlled through reciprocal regulation of enzymes that mediate its synthesis and catabolism. ACOT12, the primary acetyl-CoA thioesterase in the liver of human, mouse, and rat, is responsible for cleavage of the thioester bond within acetyl-CoA, producing acetate and coenzyme A for a range of cellular processes. The enzyme is regulated by ADP and ATP, which is believed to be mediated through the ligand-induced oligomerization of the thioesterase domains, whereby ATP induces active dimers and tetramers, whereas apo- and ADP-bound ACOT12 are monomeric and inactive. Here, using a range of structural and biophysical techniques, it is demonstrated that ACOT12 is a trimer rather than a tetramer and that neither ADP nor ATP exert their regulatory effects by altering the oligomeric status of the enzyme. Rather, the binding site and mechanism of ADP regulation have been determined to occur through two novel regulatory regions, one involving a large loop that links the thioesterase domains (Phe(154)-Thr(178)), defined here as RegLoop1, and a second region involving the C terminus of thioesterase domain 2 (Gln(304)-Gly(326)), designated RegLoop2. Mutagenesis confirmed that Arg(312) and Arg(313) are crucial for this mode of regulation, and novel interactions with the START domain are presented together with insights into domain swapping within eukaryotic thioesterases for substrate recognition. In summary, these experiments provide the first structural insights into the regulation of this enzyme family, revealing an alternate hypothesis likely to be conserved throughout evolution.", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.589408", "pmid": "25002576", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "M114.589408"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4148856"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "1VPM"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "1YLI"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "2GVH"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "2Q2B"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "2V1O"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "3B7K"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "4MOB"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "4MOC"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b4376e6626754f4f94a5c1d7d774a005.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b4376e6626754f4f94a5c1d7d774a005"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ad07ece3422b4f85a1de48e5684674fa", "title": "The Arthonialean challenge: Restructuring Arthoniaceae", "authors": [{"family": "Frisch", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Thor", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ertz", "given": "Damien", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Grube", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-08-28", "journal": {"volume": "63", "issn": "0040-0262", "issue": "4", "pages": "727-744", "title": "Taxon"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.12705/634.20", "pmid": null, "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad07ece3422b4f85a1de48e5684674fa.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad07ece3422b4f85a1de48e5684674fa"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8a39ed8268da427f9f955b67ecc803bf", "title": "A multicentre hospital outbreak in Sweden caused by introduction of a vanB2 transposon into a stably maintained pRUM-plasmid in an Enterococcus faecium ST192 clone.", "authors": [{"family": "Sivertsen", "given": "Audun", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Billstr\u00f6m", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Melefors", "given": "\u00d6jar", "initials": "\u00d6"}, {"family": "Liljequist", "given": "Barbro Olsson", "initials": "BO"}, {"family": "Wisell", "given": "Karin Tegmark", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Ullberg", "given": "M\u00e5ns", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "\u00d6zenci", "given": "Volkan", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Sundsfjord", "given": "Arnfinn", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hegstad", "given": "Kristin", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-08-25", "journal": {"volume": "9", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "8", "pages": "e103274", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "The clonal dissemination of VanB-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) strains in three Swedish hospitals between 2007 and 2011 prompted further analysis to reveal the possible origin and molecular characteristics of the outbreak strain. A representative subset of VREfm isolates (n\u200a=\u200a18) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEfm, n\u200a=\u200a2) reflecting the spread in time and location was approached by an array of methods including: selective whole genome sequencing (WGS; n\u200a=\u200a3), multi locus sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial susceptibility testing, virulence gene profiling, identification of mobile genetic elements conferring glycopeptide resistance and their ability to support glycopeptide resistance transfer. In addition, a single VREfm strain with an unrelated PFGE pattern collected prior to the outbreak was examined by WGS. MLST revealed a predominance of ST192, belonging to a hospital adapted high-risk lineage harbouring several known virulence determinants (n\u226510). The VREfm outbreak strain was resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, and susceptible to teicoplanin. Consistently, a vanB2-subtype as part of Tn1549/Tn5382 with a unique genetic signature was identified in the VREfm outbreak strains. Moreover, Southern blot hybridisation analyses of PFGE separated S1 nuclease-restricted total DNAs and filter mating experiments showed that vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 was located in a 70-kb sized rep17/pRUM plasmid readily transferable between E. faecium. This plasmid contained an axe-txe toxin-antitoxin module associated with stable maintenance. The two clonally related VSEfm harboured a 40 kb rep17/pRUM plasmid absent of the 30 kb vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 gene complex. Otherwise, these two isolates were similar to the VREfm outbreak strain in virulence- and resistance profile. In conclusion, our observations support that the origin of the multicentre outbreak was caused by an introduction of vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 into a rep17/pRUM plasmid harboured in a pre-existing high-risk E. faecium ST192 clone.

Unexpectedly, A. kona mtDNA is missing roughly 40% of the protein-coding genes and nearly half of the transfer RNAs found in the only other sequenced heterolobosean mtDNAs, those of Naegleria spp. Instead, over a quarter of A. kona mtDNA consists of novel open reading frames. Eleven of the 16 protein-coding genes missing from A. kona mtDNA were identified in its nuclear DNA and polyA RNA, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that at least 10 of these 11 putative nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NcMt) proteins arose by direct transfer from the mitochondrion. Acrasis kona mtDNA also employs C-to-U type RNA editing, and 12 homologs of DYW-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins implicated in plant organellar RNA editing are found in A. kona nuclear DNA. A mapping of mitochondrial gene content onto a consensus phylogeny reveals a sporadic pattern of relative stasis and rampant gene loss in Discoba. Rampant loss occurred independently in the unique common lineage leading to Heterolobosea + Tsukubamonadida and later in the unique lineage leading to Acrasis.

We further show that the mivaRNA duplex is subjected to a highly asymmetric RISC loading with the 3'-strand from all VA RNAs being the favored strand, except for the Ad37 VA RNAII, where the 5'-mivaRNAII strand was preferentially assembled into RISC. Although the mivaRNA seed sequences are not fully conserved between the HAds a bioinformatics prediction approach suggests that a large fraction of the VA RNAII-, but not the VA RNAI-derived mivaRNAs still are able to target the same cellular genes. Using small RNA deep sequencing we demonstrate that the Dicer processing event in the terminal stem of the VA RNAs is not unique and generates 3'-mivaRNAs with a slight variation of the position of the 5' terminal nucleotide in the RISC loaded guide strand. Also, we show that all analyzed VA RNAs, except Ad37 VA RNAI and Ad5 VA RNAII, utilize an alternative upstream A start site in addition to the classical +1 G start site. Further, the 5'-mivaRNAs with an A start appears to be preferentially incorporated into RISC. Although the majority of mivaRNA research has been done using Ad5 as the model system our analysis demonstrates that the mivaRNAs expressed in Ad11- and Ad37-infected cells are the most abundant mivaRNAs associated with Ago2-containing RISC.

A bloom of a single ribotype (\u226599% similarity in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) of a widespread betaproteobacterium (Janthinobacterium sp.) occurred over 2 weeks in Arctic marine waters. The Janthinobacterium population was not detected microscopically in situ in January and early February, but suddenly appeared in the water column thereafter, eventually accounting for up to 20% of bacterial cells in mid February. During the bloom, this bacterium was detected at open water sites up to 50 km apart, being abundant down to more than 300 m. This event is one of the largest monospecific bacterial blooms reported in polar oceans. It is also remarkable because Betaproteobacteria are typically found only in low abundance in marine environments. In particular, Janthinobacterium were known from non-marine habitats and had previously been detected only in the rare biosphere of seawater samples, including the polar oceans. The Arctic Janthinobacterium formed mucilagenous monolayer aggregates after short (ca. 8 h) incubations, suggesting that biofilm formation may play a role in maintaining rare bacteria in pelagic marine environments.

One avenue is to measure the presence of cell-free circulating tumor DNA in plasma. Various approaches have been investigated, predominantly covering hotspot mutations or customized, patient-specific assays. Therefore, we investigated the utility of using exome sequencing to monitor circulating tumor DNA levels through the detection of single nucleotide variants in plasma. Two technologies, claiming to offer efficient library preparation from nanogram levels of DNA, were evaluated. This allowed us to estimate the proportion of starting molecules measurable by sequence capture (<5%). As cell-free DNA is highly fragmented, we designed and provide software for efficient identification of PCR duplicates in single-end libraries with a varying size distribution. On average, this improved sequence coverage by 38% in comparison to standard tools. By exploiting the redundant information in PCR-duplicates the background noise was reduced to \u223c1/35,000. By applying our optimized analysis pipeline to a simulation analysis, we determined the current sensitivity limit to \u223c1/2400, starting with 30 ng of cell-free DNA. Subsequently, circulating tumor DNA levels were assessed in seven breast- and one prostate cancer patient.

First, we tested what types of genetic variation can be detected by this method using direct re-sequencing and comparison to the Littorina genome draft. Secondly, we performed a genome-wide comparison of four closely related Littorina species: L. fabalis, L. compressa, L. arcana and L. saxatilis and of populations of L. saxatilis found in Spain, Britain and Sweden. Finally, we tested whether we could identify genetic variation underlying \"Crab\" and \"Wave\" ecotypes of L. saxatilis.\n\nWe could reliably detect copy number variations, deletions and high sequence divergence (i.e. above 3%), but not single nucleotide polymorphisms. The overall hybridization pattern and number of significantly diverged genes were in close agreement with earlier phylogenetic reconstructions based on single genes. The trichotomy of L. arcana, L. compressa and L. saxatilis could not be resolved and we argue that these divergence events have occurred recently and very close in time. We found evidence for high levels of segmental duplication in the Littorina genome (10% of the transcripts represented on the array and up to 23% of the analyzed genomic fragments); duplicated genes and regions were mostly the same in all analyzed species. Finally, this method discriminated geographically distant populations of L. saxatilis, but we did not detect any significant genome divergence associated with ecotypes of L. saxatilis.\n\nThe present study provides new information on the sensitivity and the potential use of oligonucleotide arrays for genotyping of non-model organisms. Applying this method to Littorina species yields insights into genome evolution following the recent species radiation and supports earlier single-gene based phylogenies. Genetic differentiation of L. saxatilis ecotypes was not detected in this study, despite pronounced innate phenotypic differences.

To determine the genetic traits involved in the mechanism of plant-bacteria association, the genome sequence of UCMB5113 was obtained by assembling paired-end Illumina reads. The assembled chromosome of 3,889,532 bp was predicted to encode 3,656 proteins.

Moreover, annotation identified putative genes responsible for non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites and genes supporting environment fitness of UCMB5113 including drug and metal resistance. A large number of genes encoding a diverse set of secretory proteins, enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism and carbohydrate active enzymes were found which reflect a high capacity to degrade various rhizosphere macromolecules.

Our results show that exposing carotid body slices to hypoxia for a period as brief as 5 min markedly facilitates the release of ACh and ATP. Furthermore, prolonged hypoxia for 1 h induces an increased release of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that type 1 cells of the human carotid body express an array of cytokine receptors as well as hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ACh and ATP are released from the human carotid body in response to hypoxia, suggesting that these neurotransmitters, as in several experimental animal models, play a role in hypoxic signalling also in the human carotid body.

We found that flycatcher and zebra finch chromosomes are entirely syntenic but that inversions at mean rates of 1.5-2.0 event (6.6-7.5\u00a0Mb) per My have changed the organization within chromosomes, rates high enough for inversions to potentially have been involved with many speciation events during avian evolution.

The origin of BFH is unknown, and it has been questioned whether it is a true neoplasm. Chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were used to search for recurrent somatic mutations in a series of BFH. BFHs were found to harbor recurrent fusions of genes encoding membrane-associated proteins (podoplanin, CD63 and LAMTOR1) with genes encoding protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms PRKCB and PRKCD. PKCs are serine-threonine kinases that through their many phosphorylation targets are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, as well as tumor development. When inactive, the amino-terminal, regulatory domain of PKCs suppresses the activity of their catalytic domain. Upon activation, which requires several steps, they typically translocate to cell membranes, where they interact with different signaling pathways. The detected PDPN-PRKCB, CD63-PRKCD and LAMTOR1-PRKCD gene fusions are all predicted to result in chimeric proteins consisting of the membrane-binding part of PDPN, CD63 or LAMTOR1 and the entire catalytic domain of the PKC. This novel pathogenetic mechanism should result in constitutive kinase activity at an ectopic location. The results show that BFH indeed is a true neoplasm, and that distorted PKC activity is essential for tumorigenesis. The findings also provide means to differentiate BFH from other skin and soft tissue tumors.

A focused bead array was then built to further profile eight selected protein targets in all available samples.\r\n\r\nDisease-associated significant differences were observed and replicated for profiles from antibodies targeting the proteins: neurofilament medium polypeptide (NEFM), solute carrier family 25 (SLC25A20), and regulator of G-protein signaling 18 (RGS18).\r\n\r\nUpon further validation in several independent cohorts with inclusion of a broad range of other neurological disorders as controls, the alterations of these three protein profiles in plasma could potentially provide new molecular markers of disease that contribute to the quest of understanding ALS pathology.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.83", "pmid": "25356426", "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4184557"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7667c1109ce844e994cca622ff027fa5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/7667c1109ce844e994cca622ff027fa5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9205e2a365524112aee929b371133ea5", "title": "Cluster of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in humans in a tertiary hospital.", "authors": [{"family": "Starlander", "given": "Gustaf", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "B\u00f6rjesson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gr\u00f6nlund-Andersson", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Tellgren-Roth", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Melhus", "given": "Asa", "initials": "A"}], "type": "case reports", "published": "2014-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "52", "issn": "1098-660X", "issue": "8", "pages": "3118-3120", "title": "J.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Swedish population has identified a susceptibility locus for cervical cancer within the HLA-DP region. To further study this locus, we imputed classic HLA alleles using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and analysed 449 genotyped and 3066 imputed SNPs in 1034 cervical cancer patients and 3948 controls. We confirmed that the strongest signal came from a SNP located at HLA-DPB2 [rs3117027, odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.43, P = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-6) for A allele] and that this effect is not driven by associations with classic HLA alleles. In silico analysis further revealed that this SNP is highly correlated with rs3129294 (D' = 1, r(2) = 0.95 in controls), which may have a putative regulatory function. We also identified an independent association at DPB1*0402, which conferred decreased risk of cervical cancer (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63-0.89, P = 7.0 \u00d7 10(-4)) and is independent of previously described associations with HLA-B*0702, DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602, and DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603. No association was found with the two SNPs (rs4282438 or rs9277952) that were recently identified within the HLA-DP region in a cervical cancer GWAS in the Chinese population.

Candida albicans is the most virulent member of the CUG clade of yeasts and a common cause of both superficial and invasive infections. We therefore hypothesized that C. albicans possesses distinct pathogenicity mechanisms. In silico genome subtraction and comparative transcriptional analysis identified a total of 65 C. albicans-specific genes (ASGs) expressed during infection. Phenotypic characterization of six ASG-null mutants demonstrated that these genes are dispensable for in vitro growth but play defined roles in host-pathogen interactions. Based on these analyses, we investigated two ASGs in greater detail. An orf19.6688\u0394 mutant was found to be fully virulent in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis and to induce higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) following incubation with murine macrophages. A pga16\u0394 mutant, on the other hand, exhibited attenuated virulence. Moreover, we provide evidence that secondary filamentation events (multiple hyphae emerging from a mother cell and hyphal branching) contribute to pathogenicity: PGA16 deletion did not influence primary hypha formation or extension following contact with epithelial cells; however, multiple hyphae and hyphal branching were strongly reduced. Significantly, these hyphae failed to damage host cells as effectively as the multiple hypha structures formed by wild-type C. albicans cells. Together, our data show that species-specific genes of a eukaryotic pathogen can play important roles in pathogenicity.", "doi": "10.1128/EC.00051-14", "pmid": "24610660", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "EC.00051-14"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4135803"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad88c1eae7bd46ffb0916ab500e8af31.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad88c1eae7bd46ffb0916ab500e8af31"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b6cafc3c2e8747d3b4253736edbab320", "title": "Multifactorial analysis of changes in body mass index across the adult life course: a study with 65 years of follow-up.", "authors": [{"family": "Dahl", "given": "A K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Reynolds", "given": "C A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Fall", "given": "T", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "P K E", "initials": "PK"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "N L", "initials": "NL"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-08-00", "journal": {"volume": "38", "issn": "1476-5497", "issue": "8", "pages": "1133-1141", "title": "Int J Obes (Lond)"}, "abstract": "Although the negative consequences on health of being obese are well known, most adults gain weight across the lifespan. The general increase in body mass index (BMI) is mainly considered to originate from behavioral and environmental changes; however, few studies have evaluated the influence of these factors on change in BMI in the presence of genetic risk. We aimed to study the influence of multifactorial causes of change in BMI, over 65 years.\n\nTotally, 6130 participants from TwinGene, who had up to five assessments, and 536 from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, who had up to 12 assessments, ranging over 65 years were included. The influence of lifestyle factors, birth cohort, cardiometabolic diseases and an individual obesity genetic risk score (OGRS) based on 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms on change in BMI was evaluated with a growth model. For both sexes, BMI increased from early adulthood to age of 65 years, after which the increase leveled off; BMI declined after age of 80 years. A higher OGRS, birth after 1925 and cardiometabolic diseases were associated with higher average BMI and a steeper increase in BMI prior to 65 years of age. Among men, few factors were identified that influence BMI trajectories in late life, whereas for women type 2 diabetes mellitus and dementia were associated with a steeper decrease in BMI after the age of 65 years.\n\nThere are two turning points in BMI in late adulthood, one at the age of 65 years and one at the age 80 years.

Alongside improved laboratory protocols the development of bioinformatical tools is steadily progressing. In the current procedure the Illumina TruSeq library preparation kit is used, along with additional reagents, to make stranded libraries in an automated fashion which are then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000. By the use of freely available bioinformatical tools we show, through quality metrics, that the protocol is robust and reproducible. We further highlight the practicality of strand specific libraries by comparing expression of strand specific libraries to non-stranded libraries, by looking at known antisense transcription of pseudogenes and by identifying novel transcription. Furthermore, two ribosomal depletion kits, RiboMinus and RiboZero, are compared and two sequence aligners, Tophat2 and STAR, are also compared.\n\nThe, non-stranded, Illumina TruSeq kit can be adapted to generate strand specific libraries and can be used to access detailed information on the transcriptome. The RiboZero kit is very effective in removing ribosomal RNA from total RNA and the STAR aligner produces high mapping yield in a short time. Strand specific data gives more detailed and correct results than does non-stranded data as we show when estimating expression values and in assembling transcripts. Even well annotated genomes need improvements and corrections which can be achieved using strand specific data.\n\nResearchers in the field should strive to use strand specific data; it allows for more confidence in the data analysis and is less likely to lead to false conclusions.

Although differential PRDX1 expression has been described in many tumors, the potential role of PRDX1 in breast cancer remains highly ambiguous. Using a comprehensive antibody-based proteomics approach, we interrogated PRDX1 protein as a putative biomarker in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.\n\nAn anti-PRDX1 antibody was validated in breast cancer cell lines using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology. PRDX1 protein expression was evaluated in two independent breast cancer cohorts, represented on a screening RPPA (n = 712) and a validation tissue microarray (n = 498). In vitro assays were performed exploring the functional contribution of PRDX1, with oxidative stress conditions mimicked via treatment with H2O2, peroxynitrite, or adenanthin, a PRDX1/2 inhibitor.\n\nIn ER-positive cases, high PRDX1 protein expression is a biomarker of improved prognosis across both cohorts. In the validation cohort, high PRDX1 expression was an independent predictor of improved relapse-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40 to 0.96, P = 0.032), breast cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.79, P = 0.006) and overall survival (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.85, P = 0.004).

PRDX1 knockdown further sensitized cells to H2O2- and peroxynitrite-mediated effects, whilst PRDX1 overexpression protected against this response. Inhibition of PRDX1/2 antioxidant activity with adenanthin dramatically reduced ER\u03b1 levels in breast cancer cells.\n\nPRDX1 is shown to be an independent predictor of improved outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer. Through its antioxidant function, PRDX1 may prevent oxidative stress-mediated ER\u03b1 loss, thereby potentially contributing to maintenance of an ER-positive phenotype in mammary tumors.

The populations exhibit significant differences in their life history traits, e.g. butterflies from fragmented landscapes have higher flight metabolic rate and dispersal rate in the field, and higher larval growth rate, than butterflies from continuous landscapes. In fragmented landscapes, local populations are small and have a high risk of local extinction, and hence the long-term persistence at the landscape level is based on frequent re-colonization of vacant habitat patches, which is predicted to select for increased dispersal rate. Using RNA-seq data and a common garden experiment, we found that a large number of genes (1,841) were differentially expressed between the landscape types. Hexamerin genes, the expression of which has previously been shown to have high heritability and which correlate strongly with larval development time in the Glanville fritillary, had higher expression in fragmented than continuous landscapes. Genes that were more highly expressed in butterflies from newly-established than old local populations within a fragmented landscape were also more highly expressed, at the landscape level, in fragmented than continuous landscapes. This result suggests that recurrent extinctions and re-colonizations in fragmented landscapes select a for specific expression profile. Genes that were significantly up-regulated following an experimental flight treatment had higher basal expression in fragmented landscapes, indicating that these butterflies are genetically primed for frequent flight. Active flight causes oxidative stress, but butterflies from fragmented landscapes were more tolerant of hypoxia.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci influencing cross-sectional lung function, but less is known about genes influencing longitudinal change in lung function.\n\nWe performed GWAS of the rate of change in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) in 14 longitudinal, population-based cohort studies comprising 27,249 adults of European ancestry using linear mixed effects model and combined cohort-specific results using fixed effect meta-analysis to identify novel genetic loci associated with longitudinal change in lung function. Gene expression analyses were subsequently performed for identified genetic loci. As a secondary aim, we estimated the mean rate of decline in FEV1 by smoking pattern, irrespective of genotypes, across these 14 studies using meta-analysis.\n\nThe overall meta-analysis produced suggestive evidence for association at the novel IL16/STARD5/TMC3 locus on chromosome 15 (P \u200a=\u200a 5.71 \u00d7 10(-7)). In addition, meta-analysis using the five cohorts with \u22653 FEV1 measurements per participant identified the novel ME3 locus on chromosome 11 (P \u200a=\u200a 2.18 \u00d7 10(-8)) at genome-wide significance. Neither locus was associated with FEV1 decline in two additional cohort studies. We confirmed gene expression of IL16, STARD5, and ME3 in multiple lung tissues. Publicly available microarray data confirmed differential expression of all three genes in lung samples from COPD patients compared with controls.

Here, we combined data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and antibody-based immunohistochemistry across all major human tissues to explore the human liver proteome with enriched expression, as well as the cell type-enriched expression in hepatocyte and bile duct cells. We identified in total 477 protein-coding genes with elevated expression in the liver: 179 genes have higher expression as compared to all the other analyzed tissues; 164 genes have elevated transcript levels in the liver shared with at least one other tissue type; and an additional 134 genes have a mild level of increased expression in the liver. We identified the precise localization of these proteins through antibody-based protein profiling and the subcellular localization of these proteins through immunofluorescent-based profiling. We also identified the biological processes and metabolic functions associated with these proteins, investigated their contribution in the occurrence of liver diseases, and identified potential targets for their treatment.

Several agro-environmental measures at different spatial scales have been suggested to mitigate the negative impact of intensification on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The effect of these measures on the functional structure of service-providing communities remains, however, largely unexplored. Using two distinct landscape designs, we examined how the management options of organic farming at the field scale and crop diversification at the landscape level affect the taxonomic and functional structure of generalist predator communities and how these effects vary along a landscape complexity gradient. Organic farming as well as landscapes with longer and more diversified crop rotations enhanced the activity-density of spiders and rove beetles, but not the species richness or evenness. Our results indicate that the two management options affected the functional composition of communities, as they primarily enhanced the activity-density of functionally similar species. The two management options increased the functional similarity between spider species in regards to hunting mode and habitat preference. Organic farming enhanced the functional similarity of rove beetles. Management options at field and landscape levels were generally more important predictors of community structure when compared to landscape complexity. Our study highlights the importance of considering the functional composition of generalist predators in order to understand how agro-environmental measures at various scales shape community

An issue in such studies is that phenotypes are often measured by different instruments across study cohorts, requiring harmonization of measures so that more powerful fixed effect meta-analyses can be employed. Within the Genetics of Personality Consortium, we demonstrate for two clinically relevant personality traits, Neuroticism and Extraversion, how Item-Response Theory (IRT) can be applied to map item data from different inventories to the same underlying constructs. Personality item data were analyzed in >160,000 individuals from 23 cohorts across Europe, USA and Australia in which Neuroticism and Extraversion were assessed by nine different personality inventories. Results showed that harmonization was very successful for most personality inventories and moderately successful for some. Neuroticism and Extraversion inventories were largely measurement invariant across cohorts, in particular when comparing cohorts from countries where the same language is spoken. The IRT-based scores for Neuroticism and Extraversion were heritable (48 and 49 %, respectively, based on a meta-analysis of six twin cohorts, total N = 29,496 and 29,501 twin pairs, respectively) with a significant part of the heritability due to non-additive genetic factors. For Extraversion, these genetic factors qualitatively differ across sexes. We showed that our IRT method can lead to a large increase in sample size and therefore statistical power. The IRT approach may be applied to any mega- or meta-analytic study in which item-based behavioral measures need to be harmonized.", "doi": "10.1007/s10519-014-9654-x", "pmid": "24828478", "labels":

We present a novel approach to detect parent-of-origin effects (POEs) in genome-wide genotype data of unrelated individuals. The method exploits increased phenotypic variance in the heterozygous genotype group relative to the homozygous groups. We applied the method to >56,000 unrelated individuals to search for POEs influencing body mass index (BMI). Six lead SNPs were carried forward for replication in five family-based studies (of \u223c4,000 trios). Two SNPs replicated: the paternal rs2471083-C allele (located near the imprinted KCNK9 gene) and the paternal rs3091869-T allele (located near the SLC2A10 gene) increased BMI equally (beta\u200a=\u200a0.11 (SD), P<0.0027) compared to the respective maternal alleles. Real-time PCR experiments of lymphoblastoid cell lines from the CEPH families showed that expression of both genes was dependent on parental origin of the SNPs alleles (P<0.01).

The components show much variability, but some appear essential for the function, and two homologues, denoted VipA and VipB in Vibrio cholerae, have been identified in all T6SSs described so far. Secretion is dependent on binding of an \u03b1-helical region of VipA to VipB, and in the absence of this binding, both components are degraded within minutes and secretion is ceased. The aim of the study was to investigate if this interaction could be blocked, and we hypothesized that such inhibition would lead to abrogation of T6S. A library of 9,600 small-molecule compounds was screened for their ability to block the binding of VipA-VipB in a bacterial two-hybrid system (B2H). After excluding compounds that showed cytotoxicity toward eukaryotic cells, that inhibited growth of Vibrio, or that inhibited an unrelated B2H interaction, 34 compounds were further investigated for effects on the T6SS-dependent secretion of hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) or of phospholipase A1 activity. Two compounds, KS100 and KS200, showed intermediate or strong effects in both assays. Analogues were obtained, and compounds with potent inhibitory effects in the assays and desirable physicochemical properties as predicted by in silico analysis were identified. Since the compounds specifically target a virulence mechanism without affecting bacterial replication, they have the potential to mitigate the virulence with minimal risk for development of resistance.", "doi": "10.1128/AAC.02819-13", "pmid": "24798289", "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "AAC.02819-13"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4068513"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KJ735588"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KJ735589"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/680c61c3b7e842d8ba4bc1341889405d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/680c61c3b7e842d8ba4bc1341889405d"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "884c24de81744944a77486515580b3b2", "title": "'Geoarchaeote NAG1' is a deeply rooting lineage of the archaeal order Thermoproteales rather than a new phylum.", "authors": [{"family": "Guy", "given": "Lionel", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Spang", "given": "Anja", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Saw", "given": "Jimmy H", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Ettema", "given": "Thijs J G", "initials": "TJ"}], "type": "comment", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1751-7370", "issue": "7", "pages": "1353-1357", "title": "ISME J"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/ismej.2014.6", "pmid": "24522265", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ismej20146"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4069404"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/884c24de81744944a77486515580b3b2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/884c24de81744944a77486515580b3b2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a4ed16e6d9824441a0581838deee8069", "title": "Structural basis for PTPA interaction with the invariant C-terminal tail of PP2A.", "authors": [{"family": "L\u00f6w", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Quistgaard", "given": "Esben M", "initials": "EM"}, {"family": "Kovermann", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Anandapadamanaban", "given": "Madhanagopal", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Balbach", "given": "Jochen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nordlund", "given": "P\u00e4r", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "395", "issn": "1437-4315", "issue": "7-8", "pages": "881-889", "title": "Biol.

The C-terminal tail of the catalytic subunit of PP2A is highly conserved and can undergo a number of posttranslational modifications that serve to regulate the function of PP2A. Here we have studied structurally the interaction of PTPA with the conserved C-terminal tail of the catalytic subunit carrying different posttranslational modifications. We have identified an additional interaction site for the invariant C-terminal tail of the catalytic subunit on PTPA, which can be modulated via posttranslational modifications. We show that phosphorylation of Tyr307(PP2A-C) or carboxymethylation of Leu309(PP2A-C) abrogates or diminishes binding of the C-terminal tail, whereas phosphorylation of Thr304(PP2A-C) is of no consequence.

The disorder is characterized by disproportionate short stature with short trunk, scoliosis and platyspondyly. The phenotypic variability and long-term natural course remain inadequately characterized. The purpose of this study was to describe a large Swedish family with brachyolmia type 3 due to a heterozygous TRPV4 mutation c.1847G>A (p.R616Q) in 11 individuals. The mutation has previously been detected in another family with autosomal dominant brachyolmia [Rock et al., 2008]. Review of hospital records and patient assessments indicated that clinical symptoms of brachyolmia became evident by school age with chronic pain in the spine and hips; radiographic changes were evident earlier. Growth was not affected during early childhood but deteriorated with age in some patients due to increasing spinal involvement. Affected individuals had a wide range of subjective symptoms with chronic pain in the extremities and the spine, and paresthesias.

Heritability of plasma cortisol is estimated at 30-60% but no common genetic contribution has been identified. The CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium undertook genome wide association meta-analysis for plasma cortisol in 12,597 Caucasian participants, replicated in 2,795 participants. The results indicate that <1% of variance in plasma cortisol is accounted for by genetic variation in a single region of chromosome 14. This locus spans SERPINA6, encoding corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG, the major cortisol-binding protein in plasma), and SERPINA1, encoding \u03b11-antitrypsin (which inhibits cleavage of the reactive centre loop that releases cortisol from CBG). Three partially independent signals were identified within the region, represented by common SNPs; detailed biochemical investigation in a nested sub-cohort showed all these SNPs were associated with variation in total cortisol binding activity in plasma, but some variants influenced total CBG concentrations while the top hit (rs12589136) influenced the immunoreactivity of the reactive centre loop of CBG. Exome chip and 1000 Genomes imputation analysis of this locus in the CROATIA-Korcula cohort identified missense mutations in SERPINA6 and SERPINA1 that did not account for the effects of common variants. These findings reveal a novel common genetic source of variation in binding of cortisol by CBG, and reinforce the key role of CBG in determining plasma cortisol levels.

We previously demonstrated that an experimental vaccine, BRSV-immunostimulating complex (ISCOM), is effective in calves with maternal antibodies. The present study focuses on the antigenic characterization of this vaccine for the design of new-generation subunit vaccines. The results of our study confirmed the presence of membrane glycoprotein (G), fusion glycoprotein (F), and nucleoprotein (N) proteins in the ISCOMs, and this knowledge was extended by the identification of matrix (M), M2-1, phosphoprotein (P), small hydrophobic protein (SH) and of cellular membrane proteins, such as the integrins \u03b1V\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b13\u03b21. The quantity of the major protein F was 4- to 5-fold greater than that of N (\u223c77 \u03bcg versus \u223c17 \u03bcg/calf dose), whereas G, M, M2-1, P, and SH were likely present in smaller amounts. The polymerase (L), M2-2, nonstructural 1 (NS1), and NS2 proteins were not detected, suggesting that they are not essential for protection. Sera from the BRSV-ISCOM-immunized calves contained high titers of IgG antibody specific for F, G, N, and SH. Antibody responses against M and P were not detected; however, this does not exclude their role in protective T-cell responses. The absence of immunopathological effects of the cellular proteins, such as integrins, needs to be further confirmed, and their possible contribution to adjuvant functions requires elucidation. This work suggests that a combination of several surface and internal proteins should be included in subunit RSV vaccines and identifies absent proteins as potential candidates for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals.", "doi": "10.1128/CVI.00162-14", "pmid": "24828093", "labels": {"Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics, Uppsala": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "CVI.00162-14"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4097437"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c0206f85d13443be9e57dd521719302b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c0206f85d13443be9e57dd521719302b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c2f170156b274272b4560b2dc5dc14b1", "title": "Affinity proteomics within rare diseases: a BIO-NMD study for blood biomarkers of muscular dystrophies.", "authors": [{"family": "Ayoglu", "given": "Burcu", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Chaouch", "given": "Amina", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lochm\u00fcller", "given": "Hanns", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Politano", "given": "Luisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bertini", "given": "Enrico", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Spitali", "given": "Pietro", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hiller", "given": "Monika", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Niks", "given": "Eric H", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "Gualandi", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Bushby", "given": "Kate", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Aartsma-Rus", "given": "Annemieke", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schwartz", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Le Priol", "given": "Yannick", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Straub", "given": "Volker", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Cirak", "given": "Sebahattin", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "'t Hoen", "given": "Peter A C", "initials": "PAC"}, {"family": "Muntoni", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ferlini", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Al-Khalili Szigyarto", "given": "Cristina", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1757-4684", "issue": "7", "pages": "918-936", "title": "EMBO Mol Med"}, "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in the broad-scaled analysis of proteins in body fluids, there is still a lack in protein profiling approaches for biomarkers of rare diseases.

Based on concordance in statistical significance and confirmatory results obtained from analysis of both serum and plasma, we identified eleven proteins associated with muscular dystrophy, among which four proteins were elevated in blood from muscular dystrophy patients: carbonic anhydrase III (CA3) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), both specifically expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) and electron transfer flavoprotein A (ETFA). Using age-matched sub-cohorts, 9 protein profiles correlating with disease progression and severity were identified, which hold promise for the development of new clinical tools for management of dystrophinopathies.", "doi": "10.15252/emmm.201303724", "pmid": "24920607", "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "emmm.201303724"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4119355"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c2f170156b274272b4560b2dc5dc14b1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c2f170156b274272b4560b2dc5dc14b1"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d240d7ffd39247508e02d31ee6c0bd14", "title": "CXCR4 Antagonists", "authors": [{"family": "Castaldo", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Benicchi", "given": "T", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Otrocka", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mori", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pilli", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Ferruzzi", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Valensin", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Diamanti", "given": "D", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Fecke", "given": "W", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Varrone", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Porcari", "given": "V", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "19", "issn": "1552-454X", "issue": "6", "pages": "859-869", "title": "J Biomol Screen"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1177/1087057114526283", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d240d7ffd39247508e02d31ee6c0bd14.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/d240d7ffd39247508e02d31ee6c0bd14"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e64d5c7a69724d43b309656b1b10139e", "title": "MiR-146a negatively regulates TLR2-induced inflammatory responses in keratinocytes.", "authors": [{"family": "Meisgen", "given": "Florian", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Xu Land\u00e9n", "given": "Ning", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Aoxue", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "R\u00e9thi", "given": "Bence", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Bouez", "given": "Charbel", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zuccolo", "given": "Michela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gueniche", "given": "Audrey", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "St\u00e5hle", "given": "Mona", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sonkoly", "given": "Enik\u00f6", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Breton", "given": "Lionel", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pivarcsi", "given": "Andor", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "134", "issn": "1523-1747", "issue": "7", "pages": "1931-1940", "title": "J.

Here we investigated the role of miR-146a in the regulation of the innate immune response of keratinocytes. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation of primary human keratinocytes resulted in an NF-\u03baB- and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent upregulation of miR-146a expression, which was surprisingly long lasting, contrasting with the rapid and transient induction of inflammatory mediators. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly suppressed the production of IL-8, CCL20, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, which functionally suppressed the chemotactic attraction of neutrophils by keratinocytes. Inhibition of endogenous miR-146a induced the production of inflammatory mediators even in nonstimulated keratinocytes, and potentiated the effect of TLR2 stimulation. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that miR-146a suppresses the expression of a large number of immune-related genes in keratinocytes. MiR-146a downregulated interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6, two key adapter molecules downstream of TLR signaling, and suppressed NF-\u03baB promoter-binding activity as shown by promoter luciferase experiments. Together, these data identify miR-146a as a regulatory element in keratinocyte innate immunity, which prevents the production of inflammatory mediators under homeostatic conditions and serves as a potent negative feedback regulator after TLR2 stimulation.", "doi": "10.1038/jid.2014.89", "pmid": "24670381", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0022-202X(15)36864-0"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e64d5c7a69724d43b309656b1b10139e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e64d5c7a69724d43b309656b1b10139e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e680d3b3a5654bf7828115db26397d05", "title": "Haplotypes of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene are strongly associated with exhaled nitric oxide levels in adults: a population-based study.", "authors": [{"family": "Dahgam", "given": "Santosh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Modig", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Torinsson Naluai", "given": "\u00c5sa", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Olin", "given": "Anna-Carin", "initials": "AC"}, {"family": "Nyberg", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "51", "issn": "1468-6244", "issue": "7", "pages": "449-454", "title": "J.

Unambiguously identifying the orthology relationship between copies across multiple genomes can be resolved by synteny, i.e. the conserved order of genomic sequences. However, a comprehensive analysis of duplication events and their contributions to evolution would require all-to-all genome alignments, which increases at N2 with the number of available genomes, N.\n\nHere, we introduce Kraken, software that omits the all-to-all requirement by recursively traversing a graph of pairwise alignments and dynamically re-computing orthology. Kraken scales linearly with the number of targeted genomes, N, which allows for including large numbers of genomes in analyses. We first evaluated the method on the set of 12 Drosophila genomes, finding that orthologous correspondence computed indirectly through a graph of multiple synteny maps comes at minimal cost in terms of sensitivity, but reduces overall computational runtime by an order of magnitude. We then used the method on three well-annotated mammalian genomes, human, mouse, and rat, and show that up to 93% of protein coding transcripts have unambiguous pairwise orthologous relationships across the genomes. On a nucleotide level, 70 to 83% of exons match exactly at both splice junctions, and up to 97% on at least one junction. We last applied Kraken to an RNA-sequencing dataset from multiple vertebrates and diverse tissues, where we confirmed that brain-specific gene family members, i.e. one-to-many or many-to-many homologs, are more highly correlated across species than single-copy (i.e. one-to-one homologous) genes. Not limited to protein coding genes, Kraken also identifies thousands of newly identified transcribed loci, likely non-coding RNAs that are consistently transcribed in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and maintain significant correlation of expression levels across species.\n\nKraken is a computational genome coordinate translator that facilitates cross-species comparisons, distinguishes orthologs from paralogs, and does not require costly all-to-all whole genome mappings.

Here, we address the question whether the tilt is an intrinsic property of the TMH in question or if it is imparted on the TMH during folding of the protein. Using a glycosylation mapping technique, we show that four highly tilted helices found in multi-spanning membrane proteins all have much shorter membrane-embedded segments when inserted by themselves into the membrane than seen in the high-resolution structures. This suggests that tilting can be induced by tertiary packing interactions within the protein, subsequent to the initial membrane-insertion step.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmb.2014.04.020", "pmid": "24793448", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0022-2836(14)00204-6"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a3889680f65b459997a465f1fe5999e5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a3889680f65b459997a465f1fe5999e5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "64275de8a5f84fe1a8046d866ba25690", "title": "Exome sequencing circumvents missing clinical data and identifies a BSCL2 mutation in congenital lipodystrophy.", "authors": [{"family": "Schuster", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Khan", "given": "Tahir Naeem", "initials": "TN"}, {"family": "Tariq", "given": "Muhammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Shaiq", "given": "Pakeeza Arzoo", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "M\u00e4bert", "given": "Katrin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Baig", "given": "Shahid Mahmood", "initials": "SM"}, {"family": "Klar", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}], "type": "case reports", "published": "2014-06-24", "journal": {"volume": "15", "issn": "1471-2350", "issue": null, "pages": "71", "title": "BMC Med.

We have studied the aerobic growth of Escherichia coli on D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose and for simultaneous uptake to occur, both the carbon catabolite repression mechanism (CCR) and the AraC repression of xylose uptake and metabolism had to be removed. The strain AF1000 is a MC4100 derivative that is only able to assimilate arabinose after a considerable lag phase, which is unsuitable for commercial production. This strain was successfully adapted to growth on L-arabinose and this led to simultaneous uptake of arabinose and xylose in a diauxic growth mode following glucose consumption. In this strain, a deletion in the phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system (PTS) for glucose uptake, the ptsG mutation, was introduced. The resulting strain, PPA652ara simultaneously consumed all three monosaccharides at a maximum specific growth rate of 0.59\u2009h(-1) , 55% higher than for the ptsG mutant alone. Also, no residual sugar was present in the cultivation medium. The potential of PPA652ara is further acknowledged by the performance of AF1000 during fed-batch processing on a mixture of D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose.

In this study, we aimed to assess genetic variations in pSS patients with GC-like formations (GC+) compared with patients without such formations (GC-).\n\nMinor salivary gland biopsies from Swedish and Norwegian pSS patients (n=320) were evaluated for GC-like formations, identifying 76 GC+ and 244 GC- patients.

This comprehensive and unbiased proteomic characterization in ESCs reveals that, in addition to the core replication machinery, proteins relevant for pluripotency of ESCs are present at DNA replication sites. In particular, we show that the chromatin remodeller HDAC1-NuRD complex is enriched at nascent DNA. Interestingly, an acute block of HDAC1 in ESCs leads to increased acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at nascent DNA together with a concomitant loss of methylation. Consistently, in contrast to what has been described in tumour cell lines, these chromatin marks were found to be stable during cell cycle progression of ESCs.

We took advantage of the antibody resources publicly available from the Human Protein Atlas project covering more than 80% of all human protein-coding genes. Epitope mapping revealed that a majority of the polyclonal antibodies recognized multiple linear epitopes, and based on these results, a semi-automated method was developed for peptide enrichment using polyclonal antibodies immobilized on protein A-coated magnetic beads. A protocol based on the simultaneous multiplex capture of more than 40 protein targets showed that approximately half of the antibodies enriched at least one functional peptide detected in the subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. The approach was further developed to also generate quantitative data via the addition of heavy isotope-labeled recombinant protein fragment standards prior to trypsin digestion. Here, we show that we were able to use small amounts of antibodies (50 ng per target) in this manner for efficient multiplex analysis of quantitative levels of proteins in a human HeLa cell lysate. The results suggest that polyclonal antibodies generated via immunization of recombinant protein fragments could be used for the enrichment of target peptides to allow for rapid mass spectrometry analysis taking advantage of a substantial reduction in sample complexity.

We measured nucleosome occupancy in human hepatic cells before and after treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21), using massively parallel sequencing. With a newly developed method, SuMMIt, for precise positioning of nucleosomes we inferred dynamics of the nucleosomal landscape. Distinct nucleosome positioning has previously been described at transcription start site and flanking TF binding sites. We found that the average pattern is present at very few sites and, in case of TF binding, the double peak surrounding the sites is just an artifact of averaging over many loci. We systematically searched for depleted nucleosomes in stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells and identified 24 318 loci.

Here, we describe, for the first time, the design and use of peptide arrays covering all human proteins for the analysis of antibody specificity, based on parallel in situ photolithic synthesis of a total of 2.1 million overlapping peptides. This has allowed analysis of on- and off-target binding of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, complemented with precise mapping of epitopes based on full amino acid substitution scans. The analysis suggests that linear epitopes are relatively short, confined to five to seven residues, resulting in apparent off-target binding to peptides corresponding to a large number of unrelated human proteins.

However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027-0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110-157 and ending 24-30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise d(N)/d(S) between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific d(N)/d(S) was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low.

Furthermore, age-related loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is frequent in normal hematopoietic cells, but the phenotypic consequences of LOY have been elusive.

Yet, these approaches mostly do not address antibody isotypes and their effector functions even though these are key points for a more detailed understanding of disease processes. Here, we present a bead array-based assay for a multiplexed determination of antigen-specific antibody levels in parallel with their properties for complement activation. We measured the deposition of C3 fragments from serum samples to reflect the degree of complement activation via all three complement activation pathways. We utilized the assay on a bead array containing native and citrullinated peptide antigens to investigate the levels of IgG, IgM and IgA autoantibodies along with their complement activating properties in serum samples of 41 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 40 controls. Our analysis revealed significantly higher IgG reactivity against the citrullinated fibrinogen \u03b2 and filaggrin peptides as well as an IgA reactivity that was exclusive for citrullinated fibrinogen \u03b2 peptide and C3 deposition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In addition, we characterized the humoral immune response against the viral EBNA-1 antigen to demonstrate the applicability of this assay beyond autoimmune conditions. We observed that particular buffer compositions were demanded for separate measurement of antibody reactivity and complement activation, as detection of antigen-antibody complexes appeared to be masked due to C3 deposition. We also found that rheumatoid factors of IgM isotype altered C3 deposition and introduced false-positive reactivities against EBNA-1 antigen. In conclusion, the presented bead-based assay setup can be utilized to profile antibody reactivities and immune-complex induced complement activation in a high-throughput manner and could facilitate the understanding and diagnosis of several diseases where complement activation plays role in the pathomechanism.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0096403", "pmid": "24797804", "labels": {"Plasma

We have performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study to determine the effect of smoke and snuff (smokeless tobacco) on DNA methylation. A total of 95 sites were differentially methylated [false discovery rate (FDR) q-values < 0.05] in smokers and a subset of the differentially methylated loci were also differentially expressed in smokers. We found no sites, neither any biological functions nor molecular processes enriched for smoke-less tobacco-related differential DNA methylation. This suggests that methylation changes are not caused by the basic components of the tobacco but from its burnt products. Instead, we see a clear enrichment (FDR q-value < 0.05) for genes, including CPOX, CDKN1A and PTK2, involved in response to arsenic-containing substance, which agrees with smoke containing small amounts of arsenic.

Genetic evidence demonstrates that csu1 mutations suppress cop1-6 phenotypes completely in the dark. Furthermore, CSU1 colocalizes with COP1 in nuclear speckles and negatively regulates COP1 protein accumulation in darkness. CSU1 can ubiquitinate COP1 in vitro and is essential for COP1 ubiquitination in vivo.

This has been attributed in part to measurement and sample limitations, as well the relative absence of molecular genetic studies. Here we present results from original analyses of a combined sample of over 12,000 twins pairs, ascertained from nine different studies conducted in five democracies, sampled over the course of four decades.

Despite a large number of plausible candidate protein biomarkers published annually, the translation to clinical use is impeded by factors such as the required size of the initial studies, and limitations of the technologies used. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a versatile molecular tool that has the potential to address some obstacles, both in validation of biomarkers previously discovered using other techniques, and for future routine clinical diagnostic needs. The enhanced specificity of PLA extends the opportunities for large-scale, high-performance analyses of proteins. Besides advantages in the form of minimal sample consumption and an extended dynamic range, the PLA technique allows flexible assay reconfiguration. The technology can be adapted for detecting protein complexes, proximity between proteins in extracellular vesicles or in circulating tumor cells, and to address multiple post-translational modifications in the same protein molecule. We discuss herein requirements for biomarker validation, and how PLA may play an increasing role in this regard. We describe some recent developments of the technology, including proximity extension assays, the use of recombinant affinity reagents suitable for use in proximity assays, and the potential for single cell proteomics.

Krill oil (KO) is a novel marine oil on the market and is also rich in EPA and DHA, but the fatty acids are incorporated mainly into phospholipids (PLs) rather than triacylglycerols (TAG). This study compares the effects of fish oil (FO) and KO on gene regulation that influences plasma and liver lipids in a high fat diet mouse model.\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF) containing 24% (wt/wt) fat (21.3% lard and 2.3% soy oil), or the HF diet supplemented with FO (15.7% lard, 2.3% soy oil and 5.8% FO) or KO (15.6% lard, 2.3% soy oil and 5.7% KO) for 6 weeks. Total levels of cholesterol, TAG, PLs, and fatty acid composition were measured in plasma and liver. Gene regulation was investigated using quantitative PCR in liver and intestinal epithelium.\n\nPlasma cholesterol (esterified and unesterified), TAG and PLs were significantly decreased with FO. Analysis of the plasma lipoprotein particles indicated that the lipid lowering effect by FO is at least in part due to decreased very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) content in plasma with subsequent liver lipid accumulation. KO lowered plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) with a minor effect on fatty acid accumulation in the liver. In spite of a lower omega-3 fatty acid content in the KO supplemented diet, plasma and liver PLs omega-3 levels were similar in the two groups, indicating a higher bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids from KO. KO more efficiently decreased arachidonic acid and its elongation/desaturation products in plasma and liver. FO mainly increased the expression of several genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, while KO specifically decreased the expression of genes involved in the early steps of isoprenoid/cholesterol and lipid synthesis.\n\nThe data show that both FO and KO promote lowering of plasma lipids and regulate lipid homeostasis, but with different efficiency and partially via different mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1186/1743-7075-11-20", "pmid": "24834104", "labels": {"Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis (BEA)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1743-7075-11-20"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC4021563"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ab517b11ac5549518f9b683d693a9a19.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ab517b11ac5549518f9b683d693a9a19"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "44a9d2a1fbe3426784536ffceadf1761", "title": "Analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome in granulopoiesis reveals timed changes and dynamic enhancer methylation.", "authors": [{"family": "R\u00f6nnerblad", "given": "Michelle", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Robin", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Olofsson", "given": "Tor", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Douagi", "given": "Iyadh", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Karimi", "given": "Mohsen", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lehmann", "given": "S\u00f6ren", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hoof", "given": "Ilka", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "de Hoon", "given": "Michiel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Itoh", "given": "Masayoshi", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nagao-Sato", "given": "Sayaka", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kawaji", "given": "Hideya", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lassmann", "given": "Timo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Carninci", "given": "Piero", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hayashizaki", "given": "Yoshihide", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Forrest", "given": "Alistair R R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Sandelin", "given": "Albin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ekwall", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Arner", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lennartsson", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "FANTOM consortium", "given": null, "initials": null}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-04-24", "journal": {"volume": "123", "issn": "1528-0020", "issue": "17", "pages": "e79-e89", "title": "Blood"}, "abstract": "In development, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been suggested to provide a cellular memory to maintain multipotency but also stabilize cell fate decisions and direct lineage restriction.

Aberrant interactions between epigenetic factors and transcription factors cause perturbations in the blood cell differentiation program that result in various types of hematopoietic disorders.

We present data on the spread of 324 natural lesions in ash shoots, branches and stems surveyed over a 32 month period. Most lesions were active and showed the greatest rate of growth during the summer; however, lesions were active throughout the year. Tree mortality was high, with more than a third of the surveyed trees dying during the study. Although many lesions permanently ceased to develop, the rate at which new lesions emerged was greater than the rate at which lesions entered a resting phase. The most common cause for a lesion going into a permanent state of rest was that it had encountered a branch-base. Genotype analysis showed that multiple infections can occur in a single tree given that different genotypes were identified in different lesions as well as in single lesions. A weak positive correlation was noted between tree health and tree size and a weak negative correlation was noted between tree overall health and lesion activity.

Methods. 17,220 twins aged 9 or 12 were screened using the Autism-Tics, AD/HD and other Comorbidities inventory. The main covariates of ODD- and CD-like problems were investigated, and the relative importance of unique versus shared hereditary and environmental effects was estimated using twin model fitting. Results. Social interaction problems (one of the ASD subdomains) was the strongest neurodevelopmental covariate of the behavioural problems in both genders, while ADHD-related hyperactivity/impulsiveness in boys and inattention in girls stood out as important covariates of CD-like problems. Genetic effects accounted for 50%-62% of the variance in behavioural problems, except in CD-like problems in girls (26%). Genetic and environmental effects linked to ADHD and ASD also influenced ODD-like problems in both genders and, to a lesser extent, CD-like problems in boys, but not in girls. Conclusions.

The gut microbiome also plays an influential role in maintaining human health, and it is a potential target for prevention and treatment of common disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Due to the extreme complexity of such disorders, it is necessary to develop mathematical models for deciphering the role of its individual elements as well as the entire system and such models may assist in better understanding of the interactions between the bacteria in the human gut and the host by use of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).

We simulated the phylogenetic information that each candidate primer pair would retrieve using paired- or single-end reads of various lengths, representing different sequencing technologies.

For this, animal models where genetic changes in specific cells and tissues can be performed in a controlled way have become increasingly important, including the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Many tumor mutants in Drosophila affect the germline and, as a consequence, also the immune system itself, making it difficult to ascribe their phenotype to a specific tissue. Only during the past decade, mutations have been induced systematically in somatic cells to study the control of tumorous growth by neighboring cells and by immune cells. Here we show that upon ectopic expression of a dominant-active form of the Ras oncogene (Ras(V12)), both imaginal discs and salivary glands are affected. Particularly, the glands increase in size, express metalloproteinases and display apoptotic markers. This leads to a strong cellular response, which has many hallmarks of the granuloma-like encapsulation reaction, usually mounted by the insect against larger foreign objects. RNA sequencing of the fat body reveals a characteristic humoral immune response. In addition we also identify genes that are specifically induced upon expression of Ras(V12). As a proof-of-principle, we show that one of the induced genes (santa-maria), which encodes a scavenger receptor, modulates damage to the salivary glands. The list of genes we have identified provides a rich source for further functional characterization.

We investigated a consanguineous Pakistani family with AR PHNED linked to the keratin gene cluster on 12p11.1 but without detectable mutations in KRT85 and HOXC13. Whole exome sequencing of affected individuals revealed homozygosity for a rare c.821T>C variant (p.Phe274Ser) in the KRT74 gene that segregates AR PHNED in the family. The transition alters the highly conserved Phe274 residue in the coil 1B domain required for long-range dimerization of keratins, suggesting that the mutation compromises the stability of intermediate filaments. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses confirmed a strong keratin-74 expression in the nail matrix, the nail bed and the hyponychium of mouse distal digits, as well as in normal human hair follicles. Furthermore, hair follicles and epidermis of an affected family member stained negative for Keratin-74 suggesting a loss of function mechanism mediated by the Phe274Ser substitution. Our observations show for the first time that homozygosity for a KRT74 missense variant may be associated with AR PHNED.

We also identified an association with ACPA(+) RA at HLA-A position 77 (p = 2.7 \u00d7 10(-8), OR = 0.85) in 7,279 ACPA(+) RA case and 15,870 control subjects. These results contribute to mounting evidence that ACPA(+) and ACPA(-) RA are genetically distinct and potentially have separate autoantigens contributing to pathogenesis. We expect that our approach might have broad applications in analyzing clinical conditions with heterogeneity at both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC regions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.02.013", "pmid": "24656864", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0002-9297(14)00071-8"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3980428"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/699cbce661ea4664b72a5dbb7460d1c9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/699cbce661ea4664b72a5dbb7460d1c9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0d17694b34a84a299e73c74e35cb17dc", "title": "CDKAL1-related single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with insulin resistance in a cross-sectional cohort of Greek children.", "authors": [{"family": "Rask-Andersen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Philippot", "given": "Ga\u00ebtan", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Moschonis", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Dedoussis", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Manios", "given": "Yannis", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Marcus", "given": "Claude", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fredriksson", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Schi\u00f6th", "given": "Helgi B", "initials": "HB"}], "type": "clinical trial", "published": "2014-04-02", "journal": {"volume": "9", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "4", "pages": "e93193", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Five novel loci recently found to be associated with body mass in two GWAS of East Asian populations were evaluated in two cohorts of Swedish and Greek children and adolescents.

No association with body mass has previously been reported for these loci in GWAS performed on European populations.

SNPs were surveyed for association with body mass and other phenotypic traits commonly associated with obesity, including adipose tissue distribution, insulin resistance and daily caloric intake. No association with body mass was found in either cohort.

Here, we report that one of the initial effects of active WNT5A signalling in malignant melanoma cells is an alteration in cellular energy metabolism and specifically an increase in aerobic glycolysis. This was found to be at least in part due to an increase in active Akt signalling and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. The clinical relevance of these findings was strengthened by a strong correlation (P < 0.001) between the expression of WNT5A and LDH isoform V in a cohort of melanocytic neoplasms. We also found effects of WNT5A on energy metabolism in breast cancer cells, but rather than promoting aerobic glycolysis as it does in melanoma, WNT5A signalling increased oxidative phosphorylation rates in breast cancer cells.

AKT-3 has also been suggested to play a role in hormone-unresponsive BC. The aim of this study was to investigate molecular alterations of AKT-3 in TNBC, to perform associated survival analysis, and to compare these findings with the incidence of AKT-3 molecular alterations in ER-positive BC.\n\nOur study revealed AKT-3 amplification and deletions in 11% (9/82) and 13% (11/82) of TNBCs, respectively. In contrast, 1% (2/209) of ER-positive BCs were found to have AKT-3 amplifications and deletions. A higher prevalence of AKT-3 copy number gains was observed in TNBC [26% (21/82)] than in ER-positive BC [9% (19/209)]. AKT-3 amplification together with Akt-3 protein expression was negatively associated with recurrence-free survival in TNBC.

It is not clear whether the reported HLA alleles are responsible for the differences in cervical cancer susceptibility, or if functional variants at other locations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region may explain the effect. In order to assess the relative contribution of both classic HLA alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC region to cervical cancer susceptibility, we have imputed classic HLA alleles in 1034 cervical cancer patients and 3948 controls in a Swedish population for an integrated analysis. We found that the protective haplotype DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603 has a direct effect on cervical cancer and always occurs together with the C allele of a HLA-DRB1 cis-eQTL (rs9272143), which increases the expression of HLA-DRB1. The haplotype rs9272143C-DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603 conferred the strongest protection against cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-0.52, P = 6.2 \u00d7 10(-13)). On the other hand, the associations with HLA-B*0702 and DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 are attributable to the joint effects of both the HLA-DRB1 cis-eQTL (rs9272143) and a frameshift mutation (G inserion of rs67841474, also known as A5.1) of the MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A gene (MICA). Variation in LD between the classic HLA loci, rs9272143 and rs67841474 between populations may explain the different associations of HLA-B*07 and DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 with cervical cancer between studies.

This translocation has not been observed in any other bone or soft tissue tumour. Interphase FISH on sections from eight additional PHEs identified the same SERPINE1-FOSB fusion in all cases. The role of SERPINE1, which is highly expressed in vascular cells, in this gene fusion is probably to provide a strong promoter for FOSB, which was found to be expressed at higher levels in PHEs than in other soft tissue tumours. FOSB encodes a transcription factor belonging to the FOS family of proteins, which, together with members of the JUN family of transcription factors, are major components of the activating protein 1 (AP-1) complex. Further studies are needed to understand the cellular impact of the aberrant expression of the FOSB gene, but as the t(7;19) resulting in the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion seems to be pathognomonic for PHE,

Plasmodium falciparum resistance to CQ is determined by the mutation at K76T of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene. Understanding diversity in the P. falciparum genome is crucial since it has the potential to influence important phenotypes of the parasite such as drug resistance. Limited data is available regarding the type of pfcrt mutant allelic type, the effect of CQ withdrawal and diversity of the parasite population in south-central Oromia, Ethiopia.\n\nFinger-pricked blood spotted on Whatman 3MM filter papers were collected from falciparum malaria patients. Parasite DNA was extracted from individual blood spots on the filter papers. The presence of K76T mutations was determined using nested PCR for all isolates. Complete sequencing of mutations in pfcrt 72-76 was done for a set of randomly selected resistant isolates. Four microsatellite (MS) markers were analysed to determine the heterozygosity.\n\nAlthough CQ was withdrawn for more than a decade, 100% of the parasites still carried the pfcrt K76T mutation. All isolates were mutant at the K76T polymorphism. Based on combinations of MS markers, seven different Ethiopian CQR variants (E1-E7) were identified. Heterozygosity (H(e)) for MS flanking the pfcrt chloroquine resistance allele ranged from 0.00 (mscrt -29, -29.268 kb) to 0.21 (mscrt -2, -2.814 kb). H(e) ranged from 0.00 (msint 3, 0 kb) to 0.19 (msint 2, 0 kb) for MS within the pfcrt gene. Both intronic and MS flanking the pfcrt gene showed low levels of diversity.\n\npfcrt CQR allele seems to be fixed in the study area. Of the different haplotypes associated with CQR, only the CVIET genotype was identified. No reversal to the wild-type has occurred in Ethiopia unlike in many Africa countries where CQR parasites declined after cessation of CQ use. Decreased diversity in CQR isolates surrounding pfcrt suggests CQ selection and homogenization among CQR parasite population. While mutation in msint 3 and mscrt -29 of the mutant pfcrt allele is being fixed, it seems that mutations in msint 2 and mscrt -2 are still evolving and may indicate the start of re-diversification of the population from a fixed 76 T population.", "doi": "10.1186/1475-2875-13-120", "pmid": "24674605", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1475-2875-13-120"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3986696"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/aa419859f32f4d4da9aeaecf85ddefbe.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/aa419859f32f4d4da9aeaecf85ddefbe"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d1d8c6bb1694458c9d2a741b769a8b06", "title": "Design, synthesis, crystallographic studies, and preliminary biological appraisal of new substituted triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-8-amine derivatives as tankyrase inhibitors.", "authors": [{"family": "Liscio", "given": "Paride", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Carotti", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Asciutti", "given": "Stefania", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Karlberg", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bellocchi", "given": "Daniele", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Llacuna", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Macchiarulo", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aaronson", "given": "Stuart A", "initials": "SA"}, {"family": "Sch\u00fcler", "given": "Herwig", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Pellicciari", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Camaioni", "given": "Emidio", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-27", "journal": {"volume": "57", "issn": "1520-4804", "issue": "6", "pages": "2807-2812", "title": "J.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a glomerular injury with various pathogenic mechanisms.

We have analyzed the urine sample of 11 biopsy-proven FSGS subjects, 8 healthy controls, and 6 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy (disease controls) by means of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). Multivariate analysis of quantified proteins was performed by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). Results. Of the total number of 389 proteins, after multivariate analysis and additional filter criterion and comparing FSGS versus IgA nephropathy and healthy subjects, 77 proteins were considered as putative biomarkers of FSGS. CD59, CD44, IBP7, Robo4, and DPEP1 were the most significant differentially expressed proteins. These proteins are involved in pathogenic pathways: complement pathway, sclerosis, cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and activity of TRPC6.There was complete absence of DPEP1 in urine proteome of FSGS subjects compared with healthy and disease controls. DPEP1 acts via leukotrienes on TRPC6 and results in increased podocyte motility and proteinuria. Conclusion. The results suggest a panel of candidate biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of FSGS, while complete absence of DPEP1 might represent a novel marker of FSGS.", "doi": "10.1155/2014/574261", "pmid": "24790760", "labels": {"Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3984796"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad30358ce2d64746ab533f7193b56a08.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ad30358ce2d64746ab533f7193b56a08"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bc61672019c8444a9aa6534bd5d51762", "title": "Visualization of angiogenesis during cancer development in the polyoma middle T breast cancer model: molecular imaging with (R)-[11C]PAQ.", "authors": [{"family": "Sam\u00e9n", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lu", "given": "Li", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mulder", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Thorell", "given": "Jan-Olov", "initials": "JO"}, {"family": "Damberg", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Tegnebratt", "given": "Tetyana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Holmgren", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rundqvist", "given": "Helene", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Stone-Elander", "given": "Sharon", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-26", "journal": {"volume": "4", "issn": "2191-219X", "issue": "1", "pages": "17", "title": "EJNMMI Res"}, "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a crucial mediator of tumour angiogenesis.

The entries reveal a general convergence of practices on most elements of the analysis and interpretation process. However, even given this commonality of approach, only two groups identified the consensus candidate variants in all disease cases, demonstrating a need for consistent fine-tuning of the generally accepted methods. There was greater diversity of the final clinical report content and in the patient consenting process, demonstrating that these areas require additional exploration and standardization.\n\nThe CLARITY Challenge provides a comprehensive assessment of current practices for using genome sequencing to diagnose and report genetic diseases.

Here, we describe the distribution, phenotype, and nerve injury-induced regulation of NECAB1/NECAB2 in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord. In DRGs, NECAB1/2 are expressed in around 70% of mainly small- and medium-sized neurons. Many colocalize with calcitonin gene-related peptide and isolectin B4, and thus represent nociceptors. NECAB1/2 neurons are much more abundant in DRGs than the Ca(2+)-binding proteins (parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and secretagogin) studied to date. In the spinal cord, the NECAB1/2 distribution is mainly complementary. NECAB1 labels interneurons and a plexus of processes in superficial layers of the dorsal horn, commissural neurons in the intermediate area, and motor neurons in the ventral horn. Using CLARITY, a novel, bilaterally connected neuronal system with dendrites that embrace the dorsal columns like palisades is observed. NECAB2 is present in cell bodies and presynaptic boutons across the spinal cord. In the dorsal horn, most NECAB1/2 neurons are glutamatergic. Both NECAB1/2 are transported into dorsal roots and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerve injury reduces NECAB2, but not NECAB1, expression in DRG neurons.

We used this information to reconstruct personalized GEMs for six HCC patients based on the proteomics data, HMR 2.0, and a task-driven model reconstruction algorithm (tINIT). The personalized GEMs were employed to identify anticancer drugs using the concept of antimetabolites; i.e., drugs that are structural analogs to metabolites. The toxicity of each antimetabolite was predicted by assessing the in silico functionality of 83 healthy cell type-specific GEMs, which were also reconstructed with the tINIT algorithm. We predicted 101 antimetabolites that could be effective in preventing tumor growth in all HCC patients, and 46 antimetabolites which were specific to individual patients. Twenty-two of the 101 predicted antimetabolites have already been used in different cancer treatment strategies, while the remaining antimetabolites represent new potential drugs.

Recently, the chemotactic tripeptide Pro-Gly-Pro was identified as an endogenous aminopeptidase substrate for LTA4 hydrolase. Here, we determined the crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with a Pro-Gly-Pro analog at 1.72 \u00c5. From the structure, which includes the catalytic water, and mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis products of Pro-Gly-Pro, it could be inferred that LTA4 hydrolase cleaves at the N terminus of the palindromic tripeptide. Furthermore, we designed a small molecule, 4-(4-benzylphenyl)thiazol-2-amine, denoted ARM1, that inhibits LTB4 synthesis in human neutrophils (IC50 of \u223c0.5 \u03bcM) and conversion of LTA4 into LTB4 by purified LTA4H with a Ki of 2.3 \u03bcM. In contrast, 50- to 100-fold higher concentrations of ARM1 did not significantly affect hydrolysis of Pro-Gly-Pro. A 1.62-\u00c5 crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in a dual complex with ARM1 and the Pro-Gly-Pro analog revealed that ARM1 binds in the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the \u03c9-end of LTA4, distant from the aminopeptidase active site, thus providing a molecular basis for its inhibitory profile. Hence, ARM1 selectively blocks conversion of LTA4 into LTB4, although sparing the enzyme's anti-inflammatory aminopeptidase activity (i.e., degradation and inactivation of Pro-Gly-Pro). ARM1 represents a new class of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor that holds promise for improved anti-inflammatory properties.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1402136111", "pmid": "24591641", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null, "Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1402136111"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3964119"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "4L2L"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "4MKT"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "4MS6"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/08fcc6efacc74b99a6e54653476bbe51.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/08fcc6efacc74b99a6e54653476bbe51"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c9bacc76e60b47b389bea37e1f3af589", "title": "Comprehensive profiling of the vaginal microbiome in HIV positive women using massive parallel semiconductor sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Ameur", "given": "Adam", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Meiring", "given": "Tracy L", "initials": "TL"}, {"family": "Bunikis", "given": "Ignas", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "H\u00e4ggqvist", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lindau", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Julia Hedlund", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Gustavsson", "given": "Inger", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Mbulawa", "given": "Zizipho Z A", "initials": "ZZ"}, {"family": "Williamson", "given": "Anna-Lise", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Gyllensten", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-18", "journal": {"volume": "4", "issn": "2045-2322", "issue": null, "pages": "4398", "title": "Sci Rep"}, "abstract": "Infections by HIV increase the risk of acquiring secondary viral and bacterial infections and methods are needed to determine the spectrum of co-infections for proper treatment.

Prior to any RNA sequencing experiment the quality of the RNA must be measured to assess whether or not it can be used for further downstream analysis. The RNA integrity number (RIN) is a scale used to measure the quality of RNA that runs from 1 (completely degraded) to 10 (intact). Ideally, samples with high RIN (> 8) are used in RNA sequencing experiments. RNA, however, is a fragile molecule which is susceptible to degradation and obtaining high quality RNA is often hard, or even impossible when extracting RNA from certain clinical tissues. Thus, occasionally, working with low quality RNA is the only option the researcher has. Here we investigate the effects of RIN on RNA sequencing and suggest a computational method to handle data from samples with low quality RNA which also enables reanalysis of published datasets. Using RNA from a human cell line we generated and sequenced samples with varying RINs and illustrate what effect the RIN has on the basic procedure of RNA sequencing; both quality aspects and differential expression.

In this study, we present the draft genome of the black grouse, which was developed using a reference-guided assembly strategy.\n\nWe generated 133 Gbp of sequence data from one black grouse individual by the SOLiD platform and used a combination of de novo assembly and chicken reference genome mapping to assemble the reads into 4572 scaffolds with a total length of 1022 Mb. The draft genome well covers the main chicken chromosomes 1 ~ 28 and Z which have a total length of 1001 Mb. The draft genome is fragmented, but has a good coverage of the homologous chicken genes. Especially, 33.0% of the coding regions of the homologous genes have more than 90% proportion of their sequences covered. In addition, we identified ~1 M SNPs from the genome and identified 106 genomic regions which had a high nucleotide divergence between black grouse and chicken or between black grouse and turkey.\n\nOur results support the hypothesis that the chromosome X (Z) evolves faster than the autosomes and our data are consistent with the MHC regions being more liable to change than the genome average.

The localization of the divisome complex is determined by the correct positioning, assembly, and constriction of the FtsZ ring (Z-ring). Z-ring constriction control remains poorly understood and (to some extent) controversial, probably due to the fact that this phenomenon is transient and controlled by numerous factors. Here, we characterize ZapE, a novel ATPase found in Gram-negative bacteria, which is required for growth under conditions of low oxygen, while loss of zapE results in temperature-dependent elongation of cell shape. We found that ZapE is recruited to the Z-ring during late stages of the cell division process and correlates with constriction of the Z-ring. Overexpression or inactivation of zapE leads to elongation of Escherichia coli and affects the dynamics of the Z-ring during division. In vitro, ZapE destabilizes FtsZ polymers in an ATP-dependent manner. IMPORTANCE Bacterial cell division has mainly been characterized in vitro. In this report, we could identify ZapE as a novel cell division protein which is not essential in vitro but is required during an infectious process. The bacterial cell division process relies on the assembly, positioning, and constriction of FtsZ ring (the so-called Z-ring). Among nonessential cell division proteins recently identified, ZapE is the first in which detection at the Z-ring correlates with its constriction. We demonstrate that ZapE abundance has to be tightly regulated to allow cell division to occur; absence or overexpression of ZapE leads to bacterial filamentation. As zapE is not essential, we speculate that additional Z-ring destabilizing proteins transiently recruited during late cell division process might be identified in the future.", "doi": "10.1128/mBio.00022-14", "pmid": "24595368", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "mBio.00022-14"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3958796"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15ae34c421fc4ad49bd6fb20eb803581.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15ae34c421fc4ad49bd6fb20eb803581"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bfd4f700d18c43ffb48bee94681c3a87", "title": "A study of embryonic stem cell-related proteins in human astrocytomas: identification of Nanog as a predictor of survival.", "authors": [{"family": "Elsir", "given": "Tamador", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Edqvist", "given": "Per-Henrik", "initials": "PH"}, {"family": "Carlson", "given": "Joseph", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ribom", "given": "Dan", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ekman", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Popova", "given": "Svetlana N", "initials": "SN"}, {"family": "Alafuzoff", "given": "Irina", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Nist\u00e9r", "given": "Monica", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smits", "given": "Anja", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-01", "journal": {"volume": "134", "issn": "1097-0215", "issue": "5", "pages": "1123-1131", "title": "Int.

Inherited variance of the SCD-1 gene seemed to be related to cancer death, especially among men with a low proportion of PUFA in the diet in a comparison of the highest with the lowest weighted genetic risk score (HR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.04).\n\nThe findings are compatible with the hypothesis that there is an association between endogenously synthesized MUFAs and cancer death.", "doi": "10.3945/ajcn.113.065714", "pmid": "24368438", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ajcn.113.065714"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0ca6618124b7481da7c89a1930e6b150.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/0ca6618124b7481da7c89a1930e6b150"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3fbc0fe2d60b4395bfbd219d0da586df", "title": "Investigation of a putative melanoma susceptibility locus at chromosome 3q29.", "authors": [{"family": "Tuominen", "given": "Rainer", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "J\u00f6nsson", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Enerb\u00e4ck", "given": "Charlotta", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Appelqvist", "given": "Frida", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Olsson", "given": "H\u00e5kan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Ingvar", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "H\u00f6iom", "given": "Veronica", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "207", "issn": "2210-7762", "issue": "3", "pages": "70-74", "title": "Cancer Genet"}, "abstract": "Malignant melanoma, the most fatal form of skin cancer, is currently increasing in incidence in many populations. Approximately 10% of all cases occur in families with an inherited predisposition for melanoma. In Sweden, only a minor portion of such melanoma families carry a mutation in the known melanoma gene CDKN2A, and there is a need to identify additional melanoma susceptibility genes. In a recently performed genome-wide linkage screen, novel loci with suggestive evidence of linkage to melanoma were detected. In this study, we have further analyzed one region on chromosome 3q29. In all, 89 affected and 15 nonaffected family members from 42 melanoma-prone families were genotyped for 34 genetic markers. In a pooled linkage analysis of all 42 families, we detected significant evidence of linkage, with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of odds (HLOD) score of 3.1 with 83% of the families contributing to the linkage score. The minimum critical region of linkage (defined by a 1LOD score support interval) maps to chromosome 3q29, spans 3.5 Mb of genomic sequence, and harbors 44 identified genes. Sequence variants within this region have previously been associated with cancer susceptibility. This study reports the presence of a putative novel melanoma susceptibility locus in the Swedish population, a finding that needs to be replicated in an independent study on other individuals with familial melanoma.

Recently, germline mutations in MAX were found to confer susceptibility to PCC and paraganglioma (PGL). A subsequent multicentre study found about 1% of PCCs and PGLs to have germline or somatic mutations in MAX. However, there has been no study investigating the frequency of MAX mutations in a Scandinavian cohort. We analysed tumour specimens from 63 patients with PCC and PGL treated at Uppsala University hospital, Sweden, for re-sequencing of MAX using automated Sanger sequencing. Our results show that 0% (0/63) of tumours had mutations in MAX. Allele frequencies of known single nucleotide polymorphisms rs4902359, rs45440292, rs1957948 and rs1957949 corresponded to those available in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database.

The recent northerly spread of BTV serotype 8 in Europe resulted in outbreaks characterized by clinical signs in cattle, including unusual teratogenic effects. Vaccination has been shown to be crucial for controlling the spread of vector-borne diseases such as BTV. With the aim of developing a novel subunit vaccine targeting BTV-8 that allows differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals, five His-tagged recombinant proteins, VP2 and VP5 of BTV-8 and NS1, NS2, and NS3 of BTV-2, were expressed in baculovirus or Escherichia coli expression systems for further study. Optimized purification protocols were determined for VP2, NS1, NS2, and NS3, which remained stable for detection for at least 560 to 610 days of storage at +4\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C, and Western blotting using sera from vaccinated or experimentally infected cattle indicated that VP2 and NS2 were recognized by BTV-specific antibodies. To characterize murine immune responses to the four proteins, mice were subcutaneously immunized twice at a 4-week interval with one of three protein combinations plus immunostimulating complex ISCOM-Matrix adjuvant or with ISCOM-Matrix alone (n = 6 per group). Significantly higher serum IgG antibody titers specific for VP2 and NS2 were detected in immunized mice than were detected in controls. VP2, NS1, and NS2 but not NS3 induced specific lymphocyte proliferative responses upon restimulation of spleen cells from immunized mice. The data suggest that these recombinant purified proteins, VP2, NS1, and NS2, could be an important part of a novel vaccine design against BTV-8.", "doi": "10.1128/CVI.00776-13", "pmid": "24451327",

We observed a significant excess in the directional consistency of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups, even at SNPs demonstrating only weak evidence of association. By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven new T2D susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci.

Monoubiquinated H2B (H2Bub1) is needed for this maintenance, promoting noncoding transcription, centromere integrity and accurate chromosomal segregation. A transient pulse of centromeric H2Bub1 leads to RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of the centromere's central domain, coupled to decreased H3 stability. H2Bub1-deficient cells have centromere cores that, despite their intact centromeric heterochromatin barriers, exhibit characteristics of heterochromatin, such as silencing histone modifications, reduced nucleosome turnover and reduced levels of transcription. In the H2Bub1-deficient cells, centromere functionality is hampered, thus resulting in unequal chromosome segregation.

This calls for systematic validations using well-designed conditions. Here, we have analyzed 13\u2009000 antibodies using western blot with lysates from human cell lines, tissues, and plasma. Standardized stratification showed that 45% of the antibodies yielded supportive staining, and the rest either no staining (12%) or protein bands of wrong size (43%). A comparative study of WB and IHC showed that the performance of antibodies is application-specific, although a correlation between no WB staining and weak IHC staining could be seen. To investigate the influence of protein abundance on the apparent specificity of the antibody, new WB analyses were performed for 1369 genes that gave unsupportive WBs in the initial screening using cell lysates with overexpressed full-length proteins. Then, more than 82% of the antibodies yielded a specific band corresponding to the full-length protein. Hence, the vast majority of the antibodies (90%) used in this study specifically recognize the target protein when present at sufficiently high levels. This demonstrates the context- and application-dependence of antibody validation and emphasizes that caution is needed when annotating binding reagents as specific or cross-reactive. WB is one of the most commonly used methods for validation of antibodies. Our data implicate that solely using one platform for antibody validation might give misleading information and therefore at least one additional method should be used to verify the achieved data.", "doi": "10.1002/biot.201300341", "pmid": "24403002", "labels": {"Cell Profiling": null, "Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c0034e9a600646e7ae016f0897affcba.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c0034e9a600646e7ae016f0897affcba"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e0bf412e7b65470aa17c3e0bc106b686", "title": "On the biogeography of Centipeda: a species-tree diffusion approach.", "authors": [{"family": "Nylinder", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lemey", "given": "Philippe", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "De Bruyn", "given": "Mark", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Suchard", "given": "Marc A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Pfeil", "given": "Bernard E", "initials": "BE"}, {"family": "Walsh", "given": "Neville", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Anderberg", "given": "Arne A", "initials": "AA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "63", "issn": "1076-836X", "issue": "2", "pages": "178-191", "title": "Syst.

In this study, we use a novel approach to estimate ancestral areas for the small plant genus Centipeda. We apply continuous diffusion of geography by a relaxed random walk where each species is sampled from its extant distribution on an empirical distribution of time-calibrated species-trees. Using a distribution of previously published substitution rates of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for Asteraceae, we show how the evolution of Centipeda correlates with the temporal increase of aridity in the arid zone since the Pliocene. Geographic estimates of ancestral species show a consistent pattern of speciation of early lineages in the Lake Eyre region, with a division in more northerly and southerly groups since \u223c840 ka. Summarizing the geographic slices of species-trees at the time of the latest speciation event (\u223c20 ka), indicates no presence of the genus in Australia west of the combined desert belt of the Nullabor Plain, the Great Victoria Desert, the Gibson Desert, and the Great Sandy Desert, or beyond the main continental shelf of Australia. The result indicates all western occurrences of the genus to be a result of recent dispersal rather than ancient vicariance. This study contributes to our understanding of the spatiotemporal processes shaping the flora of the arid zone, and offers a significant improvement in inference of ancestral areas for any organismal group distributed where it remains difficult to describe geography in terms of discrete areas.", "doi": "10.1093/sysbio/syt102", "pmid": "24335493", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "syt102"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3926304"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e0bf412e7b65470aa17c3e0bc106b686.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/e0bf412e7b65470aa17c3e0bc106b686"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ea3f84276a26432694e085a17112d87b", "title": "Detection of enterovirus in the islet cells of patients with type 1 diabetes: what do we learn from immunohistochemistry?", "authors": [{"family": "Hansson", "given": "Sara F", "initials": "SF"}, {"family": "Korsgren", "given": "Stella", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Korsgren", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}], "type": "comment", "published": "2014-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "57", "issn": "1432-0428", "issue": "3", "pages": "645-646", "title": "Diabetologia"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00125-013-3138-z", "pmid": "24352376", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3f84276a26432694e085a17112d87b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3f84276a26432694e085a17112d87b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ef02a7c09ee04259ad9d5d188407e72e", "title": "Analysis of plasma from prostate cancer patients links decreased carnosine dipeptidase 1 levels to lymph node metastasis", "authors": [{"family": "Qundos", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Johannesson", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Fredolini", "given": "Claudia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "O\u2019Hurley", "given": "Gillian", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Branca", "given": "Rui", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Uhl\u00e9n", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wiklund", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Bjartell", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Schwenk", "given": "Jochen M", "initials": "JM"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "2", "issn": "2212-9626", "issue": null, "pages": "14-24", "title": "Translational Proteomics"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.trprot.2013.12.001", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Plasma Profiling": "Collaborative"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ef02a7c09ee04259ad9d5d188407e72e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ef02a7c09ee04259ad9d5d188407e72e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f644bbecaad54a70b4af3aa0563de6a4", "title": "The Dictyostelium discoideum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RrpC silences the centromeric retrotransposon DIRS-1 post-transcriptionally and is required for the spreading of RNA silencing signals.", "authors": [{"family": "Wiegand", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Meier", "given": "Doreen", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Seehafer", "given": "Carsten", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Malicki", "given": "Marek", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hofmann", "given": "Patrick", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Schmith", "given": "Anika", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Winckler", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "F\u00f6ldesi", "given": "Balint", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Boesler", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Nellen", "given": "Wolfgang", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Reimeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "K\u00e4ller", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "H\u00e4llman", "given": "Jimmie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Emanuelsson", "given": "Olof", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Avesson", "given": "Lotta", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "S\u00f6derbom", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hammann", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-03-00", "journal": {"volume": "42", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "5", "pages": "3330-3345", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "Dictyostelium intermediate repeat sequence 1 (DIRS-1) is the founding member of a poorly characterized class of retrotransposable elements that contain inverse long terminal repeats and tyrosine recombinase instead of DDE-type integrase enzymes. In Dictyostelium discoideum, DIRS-1 forms clusters that adopt the function of centromeres, rendering tight retrotransposition control critical to maintaining chromosome integrity. We report that in deletion strains of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RrpC, full-length and shorter DIRS-1 messenger RNAs are strongly enriched. Shorter versions of a hitherto unknown long non-coding RNA in DIRS-1 antisense orientation are also enriched in rrpC- strains. Concurrent with the accumulation of long transcripts, the vast majority of small (21 mer) DIRS-1 RNAs vanish in rrpC- strains. RNASeq reveals an asymmetric distribution of the DIRS-1 small RNAs, both along DIRS-1 and with respect to sense and antisense orientation. We show that RrpC is required for post-transcriptional DIRS-1 silencing and also for spreading of RNA silencing signals. Finally, DIRS-1 mis-regulation in the absence of RrpC leads to retrotransposon mobilization. In summary, our data reveal RrpC as a key player in the silencing of centromeric retrotransposon DIRS-1. RrpC acts at the post-transcriptional level and is involved in spreading of RNA silencing signals, both in the 5' and 3' directions.", "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkt1337", "pmid": "24369430", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "gkt1337"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3950715"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f644bbecaad54a70b4af3aa0563de6a4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f644bbecaad54a70b4af3aa0563de6a4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c71dc7a07b0e4a3a86b069c73ed1711f", "title": "Functional tradeoffs underpin salinity-driven divergence in microbial community composition.", "authors": [{"family": "Dupont", "given": "Chris L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Yooseph", "given": "Shibu", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ininbergs", "given": "Karolina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Goll", "given": "Johannes", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Asplund-Samuelsson", "given": "Johannes", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "McCrow", "given": "John P", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Celepli", "given": "Narin", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Allen", "given": "Lisa Zeigler", "initials": "LZ"}, {"family": "Ekman", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lucas", "given": "Andrew J", "initials": "AJ"}, {"family": "Hagstr\u00f6m", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Thiagarajan", "given": "Mathangi", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Brindefalk", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Richter", "given": "Alexander R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Tenney", "given": "Aaron", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lundin", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Tovchigrechko", "given": "Andrey", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nylander", "given": "Johan A A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Brami", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Badger", "given": "Jonathan H", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Allen", "given": "Andrew E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Rusch", "given": "Douglas B", "initials": "DB"}, {"family": "Hoffman", "given": "Jeff", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Norrby", "given": "Erling", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Friedman", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Pinhassi", "given": "Jarone", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Venter", "given": "J Craig", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Bergman", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-02-27", "journal": {"volume": "9", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "2", "pages": "e89549", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Bacterial community composition and functional potential change subtly across gradients in the surface ocean. In contrast, while there are significant phylogenetic divergences between communities from freshwater and marine habitats, the underlying mechanisms to this phylogenetic structuring yet remain unknown. We hypothesized that the functional potential of natural bacterial communities is linked to this striking divide between microbiomes. To test this hypothesis, metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities along a 1,800 km transect in the Baltic Sea area, encompassing a continuous natural salinity gradient from limnic to fully marine conditions, was explored. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that salinity is the main determinant of dramatic changes in microbial community composition, but also of large scale changes in core metabolic functions of bacteria. Strikingly, genetically and metabolically different pathways for key metabolic processes, such as respiration, biosynthesis of quinones and isoprenoids, glycolysis and osmolyte transport, were differentially abundant at high and low salinities. These shifts in functional capacities were observed at multiple taxonomic levels and within dominant bacterial phyla, while bacteria, such as SAR11, were able to adapt to the entire salinity gradient. We propose that the large differences in central metabolism required at high and low salinities dictate the striking divide between freshwater and marine microbiomes, and that the ability to inhabit different salinity regimes evolved early during bacterial phylogenetic differentiation. These findings significantly advance our understanding of microbial distributions and stress the need to incorporate salinity in future climate change models that predict increased levels of precipitation and a reduction in salinity.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0089549", "pmid": "24586863", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-13-46808"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3937345"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c71dc7a07b0e4a3a86b069c73ed1711f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c71dc7a07b0e4a3a86b069c73ed1711f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fba61824121a449a9db9481239ce0548", "title": "Robust isolation of malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma.", "authors": [{"family": "Frigyesi", "given": "Ildik\u00f3", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Adolfsson", "given": "J\u00f6rgen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ali", "given": "Mina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Christophersen", "given": "Mikael Kronborg", "initials": "MK"}, {"family": "Johnsson", "given": "Ellinor", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Turesson", "given": "Ingemar", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Gullberg", "given": "Urban", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}], "type": "evaluation studies", "published": "2014-02-27", "journal": {"volume": "123", "issn": "1528-0020", "issue": "9", "pages": "1336-1340", "title": "Blood"}, "abstract": "Molecular characterization of malignant plasma cells is increasingly important for diagnostic and therapeutic stratification in multiple myeloma.

genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating \u223c10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.", "doi": "10.1038/nature12873", "pmid": "24390342", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "nature12873"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3944098"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS539022"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b5f69f441a140019e81dfde1952739e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6b5f69f441a140019e81dfde1952739e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b9dd7e5542d84061b030dfa121f6e28d", "title": "An alternative root for the eukaryote tree of life.", "authors": [{"family": "He", "given": "Ding", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Fiz-Palacios", "given": "Omar", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Fu", "given": "Cheng-Jie", "initials": "CJ"}, {"family": "Fehling", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Tsai", "given": "Chun-Chieh", "initials": "CC"}, {"family": "Baldauf", "given": "Sandra L", "initials": "SL"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-02-17", "journal": {"volume": "24", "issn": "1879-0445", "issue": "4", "pages": "465-470", "title": "Curr.

Such structures are mitotically unstable and during tumor progression they accumulate material from many different parts of the genome. Hence, their content varies considerably between and within tumors. Partly due to this extensive variation, the genetic content of many ring-containing tumors remains poorly characterized. Ring chromosomes are particularly prevalent in specific subtypes of sarcoma. Here, we have combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), global genomic copy number and gene expression data on ring-containing soft tissue sarcomas and show that they harbor two fundamentally different types of ring chromosome: MDM2-positive and MDM2-negative rings. While the former are often found in an otherwise normal chromosome complement, the latter seem to arise in the context of general chromosomal instability. In line with this, sarcomas with MDM2-negative rings commonly show complete loss of either CDKN2A or RB1 -both known to be important for genome integrity. Sarcomas with MDM2-positive rings instead show co-amplification of a variety of potential driver oncogenes.

During exponential growth, LytA accesses its peptidoglycan substrate to cause lysis only when nascent peptidoglycan synthesis is stalled by nutrient starvation or \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Here we present three-dimensional structures of LytA and establish the requirements for substrate binding and catalytic activity. The solution structure of the full-length LytA dimer reveals a peculiar fold, with the choline-binding domains forming a rigid V-shaped scaffold and the relatively more flexible amidase domains attached in a trans position. The 1.05-\u212b crystal structure of the amidase domain reveals a prominent Y-shaped binding crevice composed of three contiguous subregions, with a zinc-containing active site localized at the bottom of the branch point. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to identify catalytic residues and to investigate the relative impact of potential substrate-interacting residues lining the binding crevice for the lytic activity of LytA. In vitro activity assays using defined muropeptide substrates reveal that LytA utilizes a large substrate recognition interface and requires large muropeptide substrates with several connected saccharides that interact with all subregions of the binding crevice for catalysis.

Its major pneumococcal autolysin, LytA, is required for autolysis and fratricidal lysis and functions as a virulence factor that facilitates the spread of toxins and factors involved in immune evasion.

The factors that regulate the lytic activity of LytA are unclear, but it was recently demonstrated that control is at the level of substrate recognition and that LytA required access to the nascent peptidoglycan. The present study was undertaken to structurally and functionally investigate LytA and its substrate-interacting interface and to determine the requirements for substrate recognition and catalysis.

Technological innovations are therefore sought that can reduce the release of organic carbon into lakes and seas. In the present study, magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, functionalized with poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), and characterized using TEM (transmission electron microscopy), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), CCS (confocal correlation spectroscopy), SICS (scattering interference correlation spectroscopy), magnetism studies, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) and other contaminants using PEI-coated magnetic nanoparticles (PEI-NPs) was tested in wastewater obtained from the Hammarby Sj\u00f6stadsverk sewage plant, Sweden. The synthesized NPs were about 12 nm in diameter and showed a homogeneous particle size distribution in dispersion by TEM and CCS analyses, respectively. The magnetization curve reveals superparamagnetic behavior, and the NPs do not reach saturation because of surface anisotropy effects. A 50% reduction in TOC was obtained in 60 min when using 20 mg/L PEI-NPs in 0.5 L of wastewater. Along with TOC, other contaminants such as turbidity (89%), color (86%), total nitrogen (24%), and microbial content (90%) were also removed without significant changes in the mineral ion composition of wastewater.

First, we demonstrated pronounced migration of human MCs toward conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cell lines. Subsequent cytokine array analyses of media from cells, cultured in either serum-containing or -free conditions, revealed a number of candidates which were secreted in high amounts in both cell lines. Among these, we then focused on macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has been reported to be pro-inflammatory and -tumorigenic. Infiltration of MCs was attenuated by antibodies that neutralized MIF. Moreover, a positive correlation between the number of MCs and the level of MIF in a large cohort of human glioma tissue samples was observed. Further, both glioma-conditioned media and purified MIF promoted differential phosphorylation of a number of signaling molecules, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), in MCs. Inhibition of pSTAT5 signaling significantly attenuated the migration of MCs toward glioma cell-conditioned medium shown to contain MIF. In addition, analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs) of high-grade gliomas revealed a direct correlation between the level of pSTAT5 in MCs and the level of MIF in the medium.

LTA4H from the African claw toad, Xenopus laevis (xlLTA4H) has been shown to, unlike the human enzyme, convert LTA4 to two enzymatic metabolites, LTB4 and another biologically active product \u0394(6)-trans-\u0394(8)-cis-LTB4 (5(S),12R-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid). In order to study the molecular aspect of the formation of this product we have characterized the structure and function of xlLTA4H. We solved the structure of xlLTA4H to a resolution of 2.3\u00c5. It is a dimeric structure where each monomer has three domains with the active site in between the domains, similar as to the human structure. An important difference between the human and amphibian enzyme is the phenylalanine to tyrosine exchange at position 375. Our studies show that mutating F375 in xlLTA4H to tyrosine abolishes the formation of the LTB4 isomeric product \u0394(6)-trans-\u0394(8)-cis-LTB4. In an attempt to understand how one amino acid exchange leads to a new product profile as seen in the xlLTA4H, we performed a conformer analysis of the triene part of the substrate LTA4. Our results show that the Boltzmann distribution of substrate conformers correlates with the observed distribution of products. We suggest that the observed difference in product profile between the human and the xlLTA4H arises from different level of discrimination between substrate LTA4 conformers.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbapap.2013.12.003", "pmid": "24333438", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1570-9639(13)00425-1"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ccafdb8f28c341f78c42b9c2635cc244.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ccafdb8f28c341f78c42b9c2635cc244"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e8650248bd8f44e58a1bac39e2e0edc0", "title": "A possible genetic association with chronic fatigue in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: a candidate gene study.", "authors": [{"family": "Norheim", "given": "Katrine Br\u00e6kke", "initials": "KB"}, {"family": "Le Hellard", "given": "Stephanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nordmark", "given": "Gunnel", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Harboe", "given": "Erna", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "G\u00f8ransson", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Brun", "given": "Johan G", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Wahren-Herlenius", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jonsson", "given": "Roland", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Omdal", "given": "Roald", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "34", "issn": "1437-160X", "issue": "2", "pages": "191-197", "title": "Rheumatol.

A panel of 85 SNPs in 12 genes was selected based on previous studies in CFS. A total of 207 pSS patients and 376 healthy controls were genotyped. One-hundred and ninety-three patients and 70 SNPs in 11 genes were available for analysis after quality control.

We annotated 8067 protein coding genes in the \u223c12.9 Mbp S. salmonicida genome. Unlike G. intestinalis, promoter-like motifs were found upstream of genes which are correlated with gene expression, suggesting a more elaborate transcriptional regulation. S. salmonicida can utilise more carbohydrates as energy sources, has an extended amino acid and sulfur metabolism, and more enzymes involved in scavenging of reactive oxygen species compared to G. intestinalis. Both genomes have large families of cysteine-rich membrane proteins. A cluster analysis indicated large divergence of these families in the two diplomonads. Nevertheless, one of S. salmonicida cysteine-rich proteins was localised to the plasma membrane similar to G. intestinalis variant-surface proteins. We identified S. salmonicida homologs to cyst wall proteins and showed that one of these is functional when expressed in Giardia. This suggests that the fish parasite is transmitted as a cyst between hosts. The extended metabolic repertoire and more extensive gene regulation compared to G. intestinalis suggest that the fish parasite is more adapted to cope with environmental fluctuations. Our genome analyses indicate that S. salmonicida is a well-adapted pathogen that can colonize different sites in the host.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1004053", "pmid": "24516394", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PGENETICS-D-13-02225"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3916229"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f103ad28640547eb93ceea578e8a08c4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f103ad28640547eb93ceea578e8a08c4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f27f35383bd847d9894f66d4b1c40c4e", "title": "WNT10A mutations account for \u00bc of population-based isolated oligodontia and show phenotypic correlations.", "authors": [{"family": "Arzoo", "given": "Pakeeza Shaiq", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "Klar", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bergendal", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Norderyd", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Dahl", "given": "Niklas", "initials": "N"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "164A", "issn": "1552-4833", "issue": "2", "pages": "353-359", "title": "Am.

Trametes multicolor pyranose 2-oxidase (TmP2O) catalyzes the oxidation of various monosaccharides to the corresponding 2-keto sugars. Thus, a potential use of TmP2O is to convert the products from lactose hydrolysis, D-glucose and D-galactose, to more valuable products such as tagatose. Oxidation of glucose is however strongly favored over galactose, and oxidation of both substrates at more equal rates is desirable. Characterization of TmP2O variants (H450G, V546C, H450G/V546C) with improved D-galactose conversion has been given earlier, of which H450G displayed the best relative conversion between the substrates. To rationalize the changes in conversion rates, we have analyzed high-resolution crystal structures of the aforementioned mutants with bound 2- and 3-fluorinated glucose and galactose. Binding of glucose and galactose in the productive 2-oxidation binding mode is nearly identical in all mutants, suggesting that this binding mode is essentially unaffected by the mutations. For the competing glucose binding mode, enzyme variants carrying the H450G replacement stabilize glucose as the \u03b1-anomer in position for 3-oxidation. The backbone relaxation at position 450 allows the substrate-binding loop to fold tightly around the ligand. V546C however stabilize glucose as the \u03b2-anomer using an open loop conformation. Improved binding of galactose is enabled by subtle relaxation effects at key active-site backbone positions. The competing binding mode for galactose 2-oxidation by V546C stabilizes the \u03b2-anomer for oxidation at C1, whereas H450G variants stabilize the 3-oxidation binding mode of the galactose \u03b1-anomer.

Consequently, there is a need for more extensive genetic characterization of the disease agent Coxiella burnetii in order to better understand the epidemiology and spread of this disease. Genome reference data are essential for this purpose, but only thirteen genome sequences are currently available. Current methods for typing C. burnetii are criticized for having problems in comparing results across laboratories, require the use of genomic control DNA, and/or rely on markers in highly variable regions. We developed in this work a method for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing of C. burnetii isolates and tissue samples based on new assays targeting ten phylogenetically stable synonymous canonical SNPs (canSNPs). These canSNPs represent previously known phylogenetic branches and were here identified from sequence comparisons of twenty-one C. burnetii genomes, eight of which were sequenced in this work. Importantly, synthetic control templates were developed, to make the method useful to laboratories lacking genomic control DNA. An analysis of twenty-one C. burnetii genomes confirmed that the species exhibits high sequence identity. Most of its SNPs (7,493/7,559 shared by >1 genome) follow a clonal inheritance pattern and are therefore stable phylogenetic typing markers. The assays were validated using twenty-six genetically diverse C. burnetii isolates and three tissue samples from small ruminants infected during the epidemic in the Netherlands. Each sample was assigned to a clade. Synthetic controls (vector and PCR amplified) gave identical results compared to the corresponding genomic controls and are viable alternatives to genomic DNA.

Betaproteobacteria were dominant in all cultures inoculated with lake bacteria, but decreased during the experiment. In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria, which made up the second most abundant class of bacteria, increased overall during the course of the experiment. Other bacterial classes responded in contrasting ways to the experimental incubations causing significantly different bacterial communities to develop in response to host phytoplankton species, growth phase and between attached and free-living fractions. Differences in bacterial community composition between cyanobacteria and diatom cultures were greater than between the two cyanobacteria. Despite the significance, major differences between phytoplankton cultures were in the proportion of the OTUs rather than in the absence or presence of specific taxa. Different phytoplankton species favoring different bacterial communities may have important consequences for the fate of organic matter in systems where these bloom forming species occur. The dynamics and development of transient blooms may also be affected as bacterial communities seem to influence phytoplankton species growth in contrasting ways.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0085950", "pmid": "24465807", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-13-23394"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3896425"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ea0eb9162a574bf890e6fd1ca028cdff.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ea0eb9162a574bf890e6fd1ca028cdff"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "02b8f2bf1c8b4228a6b379d9f7302863", "title": "The basic keratin 10-binding domain of the virulence-associated pneumococcal serine-rich protein PsrP adopts a novel MSCRAMM fold.", "authors": [{"family": "Schulte", "given": "Tim", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "L\u00f6fling", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mikaelsson", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kikhney", "given": "Alexey", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hentrich", "given": "Karina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Diamante", "given": "Aurora", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ebel", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Normark", "given": "Staffan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Svergun", "given": "Dmitri", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Henriques-Normark", "given": "Birgitta", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Achour", "given": "Adnane", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2014-01-15", "journal": {"volume": "4", "issn": "2046-2441", "issue": null, "pages": "130090", "title": "Open Biol"}, "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen, and a leading cause of disease and death worldwide.

We also assess how different interpretations of the New Zealand-Antarctica vicariance event influence our age estimates. Our results suggest that the diversification of Passeriformes began in the late Cretaceous or early Cenozoic. Removing the root calibration for the New Zealand-Antarctica vicariance event (85-52 Mya) dramatically increases the 95% credibility intervals and leads to unrealistically old age estimates. We assess the individual characteristics of the seven nuclear genes analyzed in our study. Our analyses provide estimates of divergence times for the major groups of passerines, which can be used as secondary calibration points in future molecular studies.\n\nOur analysis takes recent paleontological and geological findings into account and provides the best estimate of the passerine evolutionary time-scale currently available.

Efforts to prohibit the continuous spread of HCV among these groups have been initiated by the community services and health care providers. Our goal was to understand how HCV was transmitted among IDUs within a limited population group. We provide a retrospective study (2005-2007) of the HCV transmission patterns in a population of IDUs in the Uppsala region of Sweden.\n\nEighty-two serum samples were collected from IDUs in Uppsala County. Our reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR) and sequencing method enabled a comprehensive genetic analysis for a broad spectrum of genotypes of two relatively conserved regions, NS5B and NS3, that encodes for the viral polymerase and protease, respectively. HCV RNA in serum samples was amplified and sequenced with in-house primers. Sequence similarities between individuals and subgroups were analyzed with maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees. Published HCV reference sequences from other geographic regions and countries were also included for clarity.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was possible for 59 NS5B (72%) and 29 NS3 (35%) sequences from Uppsala patients. Additionally, we also included 15 NS3 sequences from \u00d6rebro patients, making a total of 44 NS3 sequences for the analysis. By analyzing the NS3 sequences, two transmission sets were found between the IDUs (>98% sequence identity), with one set consisting of two individuals and another set consisting of three individuals. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis done with our serum samples displayed clusters that distinguished them from the reference sequences.\n\nOur method seems to enable us to trace the HCV transmission between IDUs.

Analysis of the oral phenotype of double heterozygote (Irf6(+/-);Grhl3(+/-)) murine embryos failed to detect epistasis between the two genes, suggesting that they function in separate but convergent pathways during palatogenesis.

The impact of ancestral and lineage-specific polymorphisms on dN/dS, which we here show to be substantial for closely related lineages, is generally neglected in estimation techniques of dN/dS. To address this issue, we formulate a codon model that is firmly anchored in population genetic theory, derive analytical expressions for the dN/dS measure by Poisson random field approximation in a Markovian framework and validate the derivations by simulations. In good agreement, simulations and analytical derivations demonstrate that dN/dS is biased by polymorphisms at short time scales and that it can take substantial time for the expected value to settle at its time limit where only fixed differences are considered. We further show that in any attempt to estimate the dN/dS ratio from empirical data the effect of the intrinsic fluctuations of a ratio of stochastic variables, can even under neutrality yield extreme values of dN/dS at short time scales or in regions of low mutation rate.

The strongest association was observed for young-onset (OR: 8.6; 95% CI, 5.1-14.0) and hereditary (OR: 6.6; 95% CI, 3.3-12.0) prostate cancer. Haplotype analyses supported that G84E is a founder mutation. G84E carriers have an estimated 33% (95% CI, 23-46) cumulative risk to age 80 yr of prostate cancer, compared to 12% (95% CI, 11-13) among noncarriers. For G84E carriers within the top quartile of a polygenic score of established susceptibility variants, the cumulative risk was estimated at 48% (95% CI, 36-64).\n\nHOXB13 G84E is prevalent in >1% of the Swedish population and is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of prostate cancer. One-third of G84E carriers will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has implications for surveillance in mutation carriers.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eururo.2012.07.027", "pmid": "22841674", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0302-2838(12)00832-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c9376b2a98c14a4ea3634277dfa5ace7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c9376b2a98c14a4ea3634277dfa5ace7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d1e9d47c915d403f8a36279099f188cd", "title": "SNPs within the GH-signaling pathway are associated with the early IGF1 response to GH replacement therapy in GHD adults.", "authors": [{"family": "Glad", "given": "Camilla A M", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Barbosa", "given": "Edna J L", "initials": "EJ"}, {"family": "Filipsson Nystr\u00f6m", "given": "Helena", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Carlsson", "given": "Lena M S", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Staffan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Anna G", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Per-Arne", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Johannsson", "given": "Gudmundur", "initials": "G"}], "type": "clinical trial", "published": "2014-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "170", "issn": "1479-683X", "issue": "1", "pages": "101-107", "title": "Eur.

GH dose was individually titrated to normalize serum IGF1 levels. Six SNPs in the GH receptor (GHR) and the GH signaling pathway (JAK2, STAT5B, SOCS2, and PIK3CB) genes were selected for genotyping. The GHR exon 3-deleted/full-length (d3/fl) polymorphism was analyzed using tagSNP rs6873545.\n\nAfter 1 week of GH replacement, homozygotes of the fl-GHR showed a better IGF1 response to GH than carriers of the d3-GHR (P=0.016). Conversely, homozygotes of the minor allele of PIK3CB SNP rs361072 responded better than carriers of the major allele (P=0.025).

In this study, we investigated how single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ratings of intrinsic motivation were associated to interindividual differences in improvement during working memory training. The study included 256 children aged 7-19 years who were genotyped for 13 SNPs within or near eight candidate genes previously implicated in learning: COMT, SLC6A3 (DAT1), DRD4, DRD2, PPP1R1B (DARPP32), MAOA, LMX1A, and BDNF. Ratings on the intrinsic motivation inventory were also available for 156 of these children. All participants performed at least 20 sessions of working memory training, and performance during the training was logged and used as the outcome variable. We found that two SNPs, rs1800497 and rs2283265, located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively). Scores from a questionnaire regarding intrinsic motivation did not correlate with training outcome. However, we observed both the main effect of genotype at those two loci as well as the interaction between genotypes and ratings of intrinsic motivation (perceived competence). Both SNPs have previously been shown to affect DRD2 receptor density primarily in the BG. Our results suggest that genetic variation is accounting for some interindividual differences in how children acquire cognitive skills and that part of this effect is also seen on intrinsic motivation. Moreover, they suggest that dopamine D2 transmission in the BG is a key factor for cognitive plasticity.", "doi": "10.1162/jocn_a_00478", "pmid": "24001007", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f9182525a0b34482809a4561b2c7d7c2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f9182525a0b34482809a4561b2c7d7c2"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3d35797c784344df9c41fcae984d9812", "title": "Disinfection Kinetics and Contribution of Reactive Oxygen Species When Eliminating Bacteria with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Induced Photocatalysis", "authors": [{"family": "Cai", "given": "Yanling", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Str\u00f8mme", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Welch", "given": "Ken", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-00-00", "journal": {"volume": "05", "issn": "2158-7027", "issue": "03", "pages": "200-209", "title": "JBNB"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.4236/jbnb.2014.53024", "pmid": null, "labels": {"BioMaterial Interactions (BioMat)": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3d35797c784344df9c41fcae984d9812.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3d35797c784344df9c41fcae984d9812"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "99d36791a1ce4c83b0142e2a98aad12b", "title": "A luminescence-based assay of UDP-sugar producing pyrophosphorylases", "authors": [{"family": "Decker", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Stina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kleczkowski", "given": "Leszek A", "initials": "LA"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2014-00-00", "journal": {"volume": "6", "issn": "1759-9660", "issue": "1", "pages": "57-61", "title": "Anal.
