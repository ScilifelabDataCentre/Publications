The aim of this investigation was to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with lupus nephritis, its severe form proliferative nephritis and renal outcome, in two Swedish cohorts. Cohort I (n = 567 SLE cases, n = 512 controls) was previously genotyped for 5676 SNPs and cohort II (n = 145 SLE cases, n = 619 controls) was genotyped for SNPs in STAT4, IRF5, TNIP1 and BLK. Case-control and case-only association analyses for patients with lupus nephritis, proliferative nephritis and severe renal insufficiency were performed. In the case-control analysis of cohort I, four highly linked SNPs in STAT4 were associated with lupus nephritis with genome wide significance with p = 3.7 \u00d7 10(-9), OR 2.20 for the best SNP rs11889341. Strong signals of association between IRF5 and an HLA-DR3 SNP marker were also detected in the lupus nephritis case versus healthy control analysis (p <0.0001). An additional six genes showed an association with lupus nephritis with p <0.001 (PMS2, TNIP1, CARD11, ITGAM, BLK and IRAK1). In the case-only meta-analysis of the two cohorts, the STAT4 SNP rs7582694 was associated with severe renal insufficiency with p = 1.6 \u00d7 10(-3) and OR 2.22.

This is supported by automated software to monitor system performance and display information like signal intensities and retention time stability over time, and alert upon deviations from expected metrics. Utilising the software to evaluate 407 repeated injections of a standard sample during half a year, outliers in relative peptide signal intensities and relative peptide fragment ratios are identified, indicating the need for instrument maintenance.

Multiplexed protein profiles of post-centrifugation delay were generated in 384 biotinylated samples using 373 antibodies that targeted 343 unique proteins.

Single binder and sandwich assays revealed decreasing levels of caldesmon 1 (CALD1) related to EDTA standard tubes and prolonged post-centrifugation delay of 36h.

This enabled correlation of transcripts with genotypes, other transcripts and clinical EAE phenotypes and implicated potential genetic causes and pathways in EAE. We detected 2285 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).

No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) in the main analysis combining MZ and DZ twins. In a secondary analysis including only DZ twins two SNPs (rs2033541 close to ADAMTSL1 and rs4149283 close to ABCA1)\u00a0were genome-wide significant after meta-analysis with the Finnish population. The estimated proportion of variance on the liability scale explained by all SNPs was 0.08 (P-value=0.003) when MZ and DZ were considered together and smaller for MZ (0.06, P-value=0.10) compared to DZ (0.09, P-value=0.003) when analyzed separately. In conclusion, twins and singletons can be used in genetic studies together with general population samples without introducing large bias.

Of the few reports that have focused on early smoking behaviors, association results have been mixed. This meta-analysis examines early smoking phenotypes and SNPs in the gene cluster to determine: (1) whether the most robust association signal in this region (rs16969968) for other smoking behaviors is also associated with early behaviors, and/or (2) if additional statistically independent signals are important in early smoking. We focused on two phenotypes: age of tobacco initiation (AOI) and age of first regular tobacco use (AOS). This study included 56,034 subjects (41 groups) spanning nine countries and evaluated five SNPs including rs1948, rs16969968, rs578776, rs588765, and rs684513. Each dataset was analyzed using a centrally generated script. Meta-analyses were conducted from summary statistics. AOS yielded significant associations with SNPs rs578776 (beta = 0.02, P = 0.004), rs1948 (beta = 0.023, P = 0.018), and rs684513 (beta = 0.032, P = 0.017), indicating protective effects. There were no significant associations for the AOI phenotype. Importantly, rs16969968, the most replicated signal in this region for nicotine dependence, cigarettes per day, and cotinine levels, was not associated with AOI (P = 0.59) or AOS (P = 0.92). These results provide important insight into the complexity of smoking behavior phenotypes, and suggest that association signals in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster affecting early smoking behaviors may be different from those affecting the mature nicotine dependence phenotype.", "doi": "10.1002/gepi.21760", "pmid": "24186853", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3947535"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS538239"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/488ee7f3752e40e88f157740054a9687.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/488ee7f3752e40e88f157740054a9687"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7f49476863204a018c8ee67c73b87ef9", "title": "Genetic variation at the IGF1 locus shows association with post-stroke outcome and to circulating IGF1.", "authors": [{"family": "Aberg", "given": "N David", "initials": "ND"}, {"family": "Olsson", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Aberg", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Jood", "given": "Katarina", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Stanne", "given": "Tara M", "initials": "TM"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Blomstrand", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Isgaard", "given": "J\u00f6rgen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jern", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2013-12-00", "journal": {"volume": "169", "issn": "1479-683X", "issue": "6", "pages": "759-765", "title": "Eur.

An understanding of how cyanobacteria are affected by their biofuel product can enable identification of engineering strategies for improving their tolerance. Here we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assess the transcriptome response of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 to two concentrations of exogenous n-butanol. Approximately 80 transcripts were differentially expressed at 40 mg/liter butanol, and 280 transcripts were different at 1 g/liter butanol. Our results suggest a compromised cell membrane, impaired photosynthetic electron transport, and reduced biosynthesis. Accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scaled with butanol concentration. Using the physiology and transcriptomics data, we selected several genes for overexpression in an attempt to improve butanol tolerance.

We find that DNA damage accumulation does not decrease the adult life span of post-mitotic tissue. Surprisingly, loss of functional ERCC-1/XPF even further extends the life span of long-lived daf-2 mutants, likely through an adaptive activation of stress signaling. Contrariwise, NER deficiency leads to a striking transgenerational decline in replicative capacity and viability of proliferating cells. DNA damage accumulation induces severe, stochastic impairment of development and growth, which is most pronounced in NER mutants that are also impaired in their response to ionizing radiation and inter-strand crosslinks.

It is well known that such indel events most frequently occur in surface-exposed loops. However, detailed analysis of indel events in distantly related and fast-evolving proteins is hampered by the difficulty involved in correctly aligning such sequences. Here, we circumvent this problem by first only analyzing homologous proteins based on length variation rather than pairwise alignments. Using this approach, we find a surprisingly strong relationship between difference in length and difference in the number of intrinsically disordered residues, where up to three quarters of the length variation can be explained by changes in the number of intrinsically disordered residues. Further, we find that disorder is common in both insertions and deletions.

The aim of this study was therefore to identify additional prognostic factors to better predict patients with a high risk of relapse, thus enabling us to better determine the need for adjuvant treatment in stage III disease. An RNA oligonucleotide microarray study was performed on first regional lymph node metastases in 42 patients with stage III melanoma: 23 patients with short-term survival (\u2264 13 months) and 19 with long-term survival (\u2265 60 months), to identify genes associated with clinical outcome. Candidate genes were validated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Several gene ontology (GO) categories were highly significantly differentially expressed including glycolysis (GO: 0006096; P<0.001) and the pigment biosynthetic process (GO: 0046148; P<0.001), in which overexpression was associated with short-disease-specific survival. Three overexpressed glycolytic genes, GAPDHS, GAPDH, and PKM2, and two pigment-related genes, TYRP1 and OCA2, were selected for validation. A significant difference in GAPDHS protein expression between short- and long-term survivors (P=0.021) and a trend for PKM2 (P=0.093) was observed in univariate analysis. Positive expression of at least two of four proteins (GAPDHS, GAPDH, PKM2, TYRP1) in immunohistochemical analysis was found to be an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (P=0.011).

However, there are no cultivated members of the freshwater SAR11 group and no genomes have been sequenced yet.\n\nWe isolated ten single SAR11 cells from three freshwater lakes and sequenced and assembled their genomes. A phylogeny based on 57 proteins indicates that the cells are organized into distinct microclusters. We show that the freshwater genomes have evolved primarily by the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions and that they have among the lowest ratio of recombination to mutation estimated for bacteria. In contrast, members of the marine SAR11 clade have one of the highest ratios. Additional metagenome reads from six lakes confirm low recombination frequencies for the genome overall and reveal lake-specific variations in microcluster abundances. We identify hypervariable regions with gene contents broadly similar to those in the hypervariable regions of the marine isolates, containing genes putatively coding for cell surface molecules.\n\nWe conclude that recombination rates differ dramatically in phylogenetic sister groups of the SAR11 clade adapted to freshwater and marine ecosystems. The results suggest that the transition from marine to freshwater systems has purged diversity and resulted in reduced opportunities for recombination with divergent members of the clade.

However, a detailed understanding of how such factors act together is lacking. To elucidate the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in allergic diseases, we used a novel bioinformatics approach that combines feature selection and machine learning. In two materials, PARSIFAL (a European cross-sectional study of 3113 children) and BAMSE (a Swedish birth-cohort including 2033 children), genetic variants as well as environmental and lifestyle factors were evaluated for their contribution to allergic phenotypes. Monte Carlo feature selection and rule based models were used to identify and rank rules describing how combinations of genetic and environmental factors affect the risk of allergic diseases. Novel interactions between genes were suggested and replicated, such as between ORMDL3 and RORA, where certain genotype combinations gave odds ratios for current asthma of 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.0) in the BAMSE and PARSIFAL children, respectively. Several combinations of environmental factors appeared to be important for the development of allergic disease in children. For example, use of baby formula and antibiotics early in life was associated with an odds ratio of 7.4 (95% CI 4.5-12.0) of developing asthma. Furthermore, genetic variants together with environmental factors seemed to play a role for allergic diseases, such as the use of antibiotics early in life and COL29A1 variants for asthma, and farm living and NPSR1 variants for allergic eczema. Overall, combinations of environmental and life style factors appeared more frequently in the models than combinations solely involving genes.

This defect was not significantly enhanced upon combined deletion of E2a with Ebf1 or Pax5. Analysis of the pre-B-cell compartment in Ebf1 heterozygote mice revealed a reduction in cell numbers. These cells expressed Pax5 and other B-lineage-associated genes, and global gene expression analysis suggested that the reduction of the pre-B-cell compartment was a result of impaired pre-B-cell expansion. This idea was supported by a reduction in IL2R\u03b1-expressing late pre-B-cells as well as by cell cycle analysis and by the finding that the complexity of the VDJ rearrangement patterns was comparable in Wt and Ebf1(+/-) pre-B-cells, although the number of progenitors was reduced. Heterozygote deletion of Ebf1 resulted in impaired response to IL7 in vitro and reduced expression levels of pre-BCR on the cell surface, providing possible explanations for the observed stage-specific reduction in cellular expansion.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are being touted as one such approach in the fight against heart disease, acting as possible post-transcriptional molecular triggers responsible for invoking cardiac regeneration. To further ones understanding of miRNAs and cardiac regeneration, it is prudent to learn from organisms that can intrinsically regenerate their hearts following injury. Using the red-spotted newt, an adult chordate capable of cardiac regeneration, we decided to delve deeper into the role miRNAs play during this process. RNA isolated from regenerating newt heart samples, was used in a microarray screen, to identify significantly expressed candidate miRNAs during newt cardiac regeneration. We performed quantitative qPCR analysis on several conserved miRNAs and found one in particular, miR-128, to be significantly elevated when cardiac hyperplasia is at its peak following injury. In-situ hybridisation techniques revealed a localised expression pattern for miR-128 in the cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes in close proximity to the regeneration zone and in vivo knockdown studies revealed a regulatory role for miR-128 in proliferating non-cardiomyocyte populations and extracellular matrix deposition. Finally, 3'UTR reporter assays revealed Islet1 as a biological target for miR-128, which was confirmed further through in vivo Islet1 transcriptional and translational expression analysis in regenerating newt hearts. From these studies we conclude that miR-128 regulates both cardiac hyperplasia and Islet1 expression during newt heart regeneration and that this information could be translated into future mammalian cardiac studies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.09.011", "pmid": "24055866", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0012-1606(13)00485-5"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6fdc95562b3e43dd8b114345f285b393.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/6fdc95562b3e43dd8b114345f285b393"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c1caa61eb6a045a3b3bb6d3d1a71bb72", "title": "Discovery of an allosteric inhibitor binding site in 3-Oxo-acyl-ACP reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "authors": [{"family": "Cukier", "given": "Cyprian D", "initials": "CD"}, {"family": "Hope", "given": "Anthony G", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Elamin", "given": "Ayssar A", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Moynie", "given": "Lucile", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Schnell", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Schach", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kneuper", "given": "Holger", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Singh", "given": "Mahavir", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Naismith", "given": "James H", "initials": "JH"}, {"family": "Lindqvist", "given": "Ylva", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Gray", "given": "David W", "initials": "DW"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Gunter", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-11-15", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1554-8937", "issue": "11", "pages": "2518-2527", "title": "ACS Chem.

Here, using a third study design, we show results consistent with extreme polygenicity for body mass index (BMI) and height. On a sample of 20,240 siblings (from 9,570 nuclear families), we used a within-family method to obtain narrow-sense heritability estimates of 0.42 (SE = 0.17, p = 0.01) and 0.69 (SE = 0.14, p = 6\u00a0\u00d7 10(-)(7)) for BMI and height, respectively, after adjusting for covariates.

This inflation is free of confounding and congruent with polygenicity, consistent with observations of ever-increasing genomic-inflation factors from GWASs with large sample sizes, implying that those signals are due to true genetic signals across the genome rather than population stratification. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the observed test statistics is consistent with both rare and common variants underlying a polygenic architecture and that previous reports of linkage signals in complex traits are probably a consequence of polygenic architecture rather than the segregation of variants with large effects.

Here, we searched for genes and mutations regulating growth in the Virginia chicken lines - an experimental population comprising two lines that have been divergently selected for body weight at 56 days for more than 50 generations. Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been mapped in an F2 intercross between the lines, and the regions have subsequently been replicated and fine mapped using an Advanced Intercross Line. We have further analyzed the QTL regions where the largest genetic divergence between the High-Weight selected (HWS) and Low-Weight selected (LWS) lines was observed. Such regions, covering about 37% of the actual QTL regions, were identified by comparing the allele frequencies of the HWS and LWS lines using both individual 60K SNP chip genotyping of birds and analysis of read proportions from genome resequencing of DNA pools. Based on a combination of criteria including significance of the QTL, allele frequency difference of identified mutations between the selected lines, gene information on relevance for growth, and the predicted functional effects of identified mutations we propose here a subset of candidate mutations of highest priority for further evaluation in functional studies.

Bile was sampled directly from the jejunum by duodenal aspiration via an oro-enteric tube. In Study 2, the effect of ketoconazole on the plasma and bile pharmacokinetics of AZD0837, the intermediate metabolite (AR-H069927), and the active form (AR-H067637) was investigated (n = 17). Co-administration with ketoconazole elevated the plasma exposure to AZD0837 and the active form approximately 2-fold compared to placebo, which may be explained by inhibited CYP3A4 metabolism and reduced biliary clearance, respectively. High concentrations of the active form was measured in bile with a bile-to-plasma AUC ratio of approximately 75, indicating involvement of transporter-mediated excretion of the compound. AZD0837 and its metabolites were further investigated as substrates of hepatic uptake and efflux transporters in vitro. Studies in MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressing membrane vesicles identified AZD0837, the intermediate, and the active form as substrates of P-gp. The active form was also identified as a substrate of the multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) transporter and the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), in HEK cells transfected with the respective transporter. Ketoconazole was shown to inhibit all of these three transporters; in particular, inhibition of P-gp and MATE1 occurred in a clinically relevant concentration range. In conclusion, the hepatobiliary transport pathways of AZD0837 and its metabolites were identified in vitro and in vivo.

The P450 domains contain a conserved sequence, Ala-Asn-Gln-Xaa-Gln, presumably located in the I-helices. The Asn938Leu replacement of 7,8-LDS of Gaeumannomyces graminis virtually abolished and the Asn938Asp and Asn938Gln replacements reduced the hydroperoxide isomerase activity. Gln941Leu and Gln941Glu substitutions had little effects. Replacements of the homologous Asn(887) and Gln(890) residues of 5,8-LDS of Aspergillus fumigatus yielded the opposite results. Asn887Leu and Asn887Gln of 5,8-LDS retained 5,8-DiHODE as the main metabolite with an increased formation of 6,8- and 8,11-DiHODE, whereas Gln890Leu almost abolished the 5,8-LDS activity. Replacement of Gln(890) with Glu also retained 5,8-DiHODE as the main product, but shifted oxygenation from C-5 to C-7 and C-11 and to formation of epoxyalcohols by homolytic scission of 8R-HPODE. P450 hydroxylases usually contain an \"acid-alcohol\" pair in the I-helices for the heterolytic scission of O2 and formation of compound I (Por(+) Fe(IV)=O) and water.

Experimental studies have shown an activation of NF-\u03baB in primary SS. NF-\u03baB activation results in inflammation and autoimmunity and is regulated by inhibitory and activating proteins. Genetic studies have shown an association between multiple autoimmune diseases and TNFAIP3 (A20) and TNIP1 (ABIN1), both repressors of NF-\u03baB and of IKBKE (IKK\u03b5), which is an NF-\u03baB activator. The aim of this study was to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IKBKE, NFKB1, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 genes for association with primary SS. A total of 12 SNPs were genotyped in 1105 patients from Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway, n = 684) and the UK (n = 421) and 4460 controls (Scandinavia, n = 1662, UK, n = 2798).

Here we present the crystallization of a third crystal form, P212121 (~4 \u00c5 resolution), also representing an inward facing conformation, and analyze all three forms in terms of crystallization conditions and packing. The crystallization conditions were generally very similar with only slight changes needed to favor one form over another, e.g. the presence of lanthanide ions greatly favors C2 over P212121 under otherwise identical conditions. Cadmium was essential for crystallization of all three forms, which indeed all contain a Cd(2+) ion in a crystal packing interface, though surprisingly in different positions. Cadmium was also found to bind to XylE in solution. The diffraction data were highly anisotropic for all forms, reflecting a lack of ordered crystal contacts along one or two of the cell axes. The best diffracting directions thus consistently correlate with the presence of ordered contacts, most of which are metal-mediated.

This process requires the presence of a Sec Insertion Sequence (SECIS) in the mRNA, which forms a secondary structure that binds a unique Sec-specific elongation factor that catalyzes Sec insertion at the predefined UGA instead of release factor 2-mediated termination. During overproduction of recombinant selenoproteins, this process nonetheless typically results in expression of UGA-truncated products together with the production of recombinant selenoproteins. Here, we found that premature termination can be fully avoided through a SECIS-dependent Sec-mediated suppression of UGG, thereby yielding either tryptophan or Sec insertion without detectable premature truncation. The yield of recombinant selenoprotein produced with this method approached that obtained with a classical UGA codon for Sec insertion. Sec-mediated suppression of UGG thus provides a novel method for selenoprotein production, as here demonstrated with rat thioredoxin reductase.

The class contains nematode-trapping fungi that form unique infection structures, called traps, to capture and kill free-living nematodes. The traps have evolved differently along several lineages and include adhesive traps (knobs, nets or branches) and constricting rings. We show, by genome sequencing of the knob-forming species Monacrosporium haptotylum and comparison with the net-forming species Arthrobotrys oligospora, that two genomic mechanisms are likely to have been important for the adaptation to parasitism in these fungi. Firstly, the expansion of protein domain families and the large number of species-specific genes indicated that gene duplication followed by functional diversification had a major role in the evolution of the nematode-trapping fungi. Gene expression indicated that many of these genes are important for pathogenicity. Secondly, gene expression of orthologs between the two fungi during infection indicated that differential regulation was an important mechanism for the evolution of parasitism in nematode-trapping fungi. Many of the highly expressed and highly upregulated M. haptotylum transcripts during the early stages of nematode infection were species-specific and encoded small secreted proteins (SSPs) that were affected by repeat-induced point mutations (RIP). An active RIP mechanism was revealed by lack of repeats, dinucleotide bias in repeats and genes, low proportion of recent gene duplicates, and reduction of recent gene family expansions. The high expression and rapid divergence of SSPs indicate a striking similarity in the infection mechanisms of nematode-trapping fungi and plant and insect pathogens from the crown groups of the filamentous ascomycetes (Pezizomycotina). The patterns of gene family expansions in the nematode-trapping fungi were more similar to plant pathogens than to insect and animal pathogens. The observation of RIP activity in the Orbiliomycetes suggested that this mechanism was present early in the evolution of the filamentous ascomycetes.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1003909", "pmid": "24244185", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PGENETICS-D-13-01003"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3828140"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5eec2eb4880c440a81bb8c33a7186826.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5eec2eb4880c440a81bb8c33a7186826"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9bc18320f3eb4b8c84a460c382604ee3", "title": "Antibodies biotinylated using a synthetic Z-domain from protein A provide stringent in situ protein detection.", "authors": [{"family": "Andersson", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Konrad", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ashok", "given": "Nikhil", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Hober", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Asplund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-11-00", "journal": {"volume": "61", "issn": "1551-5044", "issue": "11", "pages": "773-784", "title": "J.

Many antibody-labeling kits do not specifically target IgG and may therefore cause labeling of stabilizing proteins present in the antibody solution. A new conjugation method has been developed that utilizes a modified Z-domain of protein A (ZBPA) to specifically target the Fc part of antibodies. The aim of the present study was to compare the ZBPA conjugation method and a commercially available labeling kit, Lightning-Link, for in situ protein detection. Fourteen antibodies were biotinylated with each method and stained using immunohistochemistry. For all antibodies tested, ZBPA biotinylation resulted in distinct immunoreactivity without off-target staining, regardless of the presence of stabilizing proteins in the buffer, whereas the majority of the Lightning-Link biotinylated antibodies displayed a characteristic pattern of nonspecific staining.

We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci.

However, understanding of the sources of technical and interlaboratory variation is still limited. To address this, the GEUVADIS consortium sequenced mRNAs and small RNAs of lymphoblastoid cell lines of 465 individuals in seven sequencing centers, with a large number of replicates. The variation between laboratories appeared to be considerably smaller than the already limited biological variation. Laboratory effects were mainly seen in differences in insert size and GC content and could be adequately corrected for. In small-RNA sequencing, the microRNA (miRNA) content differed widely between samples owing to competitive sequencing of rRNA fragments. This did not affect relative quantification of miRNAs.

Assays developed in recent years are aimed at determining both the effectiveness and safety of specific drugs for a defined group of patients, thus, enabling the more efficient design of clinical trials and also supporting physicians when making treatment-related decisions. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely accepted method for protein expression analyses in human tissues. Immunohistochemical assays, used to localize and quantitate relative protein expression levels within a morphological context, are frequently used as companion diagnostics during clinical trials and also following drug approval.

However, the mechanisms of how hosts and LAB interact are still poorly understood. Previous work demonstrates that 13 species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium from the honey crop in bees function symbiotically with the honeybee. They protect each other, their hosts, and the surrounding environment against severe bee pathogens, bacteria, and yeasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that these LAB under stress, i.e. in their natural niche in the honey crop, are likely to produce bioactive substances with antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe genomic analysis of the LAB demonstrated varying genome sizes ranging from 1.5 to 2.2 mega-base pairs (Mbps) which points out a clear difference within the protein gene content, as well as specialized functions in the honeybee microbiota and their adaptation to their host. We demonstrate a clear variation between the secreted proteins of the symbiotic LAB when subjected to microbial stressors. We have identified that 10 of the 13 LAB produced extra-cellular proteins of known or unknown function in which some are arranged in interesting putative operons that may be involved in antimicrobial action, host interaction, or biofilm formation. The most common known extra-cellular proteins secreted were enzymes, DNA chaperones, S-layer proteins, bacteriocins, and lysozymes. A new bacteriocin may have been identified in one of the LAB symbionts while many proteins with unknown functions were produced which must be investigated further.\n\nThe 13 LAB symbionts likely play different roles in their natural environment defending their niche and their host and participating in the honeybee's food production. These roles are partly played through producing extracellular proteins on exposure to microbial stressors widely found in natural occurring flowers. Many of these secreted proteins may have a putative antimicrobial function. In the future, understanding these processes in this complicated environment may lead to novel applications of honey crop LAB proteins.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2180-13-235", "pmid": "24148670",

opening of their pores. The efflux of cytoplasmic osmolytes reduces the membrane tension and prevents membrane rupture. Therefore these channels serve as emergency valves when experiencing significant environmental stress. The preparation of high quality crystals of integral membrane proteins is a major bottleneck for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Crystallization chaperones based on various protein scaffolds have emerged as promising tool to increase the crystallization probability of a selected target protein. So far archeal mechanosensitive channels of small conductance have resisted crystallization in our hands. To structurally analyse these channels, we selected nanobodies against an archeal MS channel after immunization of a llama with recombinant expressed, detergent solubilized and purified protein. Here we present the characterization of 23 different binders regarding their interaction with the channel protein using analytical gel filtration, western blotting and surface plasmon resonance. Selected nanobodies bound the target with affinities in the pico- to nanomolar range and some binders had a profound effect on the crystallization of the MS channel. Together with previous data we show that nanobodies are a versatile and valuable tool in structural biology by widening the crystallization space for highly challenging proteins, protein complexes and integral membrane proteins.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0077984", "pmid": "24205053", "labels": {"Protein Science Facility (PSF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-13-33201"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3804602"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/02d4edc9fa77447d8b1c217f69c866b7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/02d4edc9fa77447d8b1c217f69c866b7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8bdc034874724611ab7e81f7f3a523c3", "title": "Eleven candidate susceptibility genes for common familial colorectal cancer.", "authors": [{"family": "Gylfe", "given": "Alexandra E", "initials": "AE"}, {"family": "Katainen", "given": "Riku", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Kondelin", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Tanskanen", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Cajuso", "given": "Tatiana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "H\u00e4nninen", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Taipale", "given": "Jussi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Taipale", "given": "Minna", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Renkonen-Sinisalo", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rvinen", "given": "Heikki", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mecklin", "given": "Jukka-Pekka", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Kilpivaara", "given": "Outi", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Pitk\u00e4nen", "given": "Esa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Vahteristo", "given": "Pia", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Tuupanen", "given": "Sari", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Karhu", "given": "Auli", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aaltonen", "given": "Lauri A", "initials": "LA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-10-17", "journal": {"volume": "9", "issn": "1553-7404", "issue": "10", "pages": "e1003876", "title": "PLoS Genet."}, "abstract": "Hereditary factors are presumed to play a role in one third of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. However, in the majority of familial CRC cases the genetic basis of predisposition remains unexplained. This is particularly true for families with few affected individuals. To identify susceptibility genes for this common phenotype, we examined familial cases derived from a consecutive series of 1514 Finnish CRC patients. Ninety-six familial CRC patients with no previous diagnosis of a hereditary CRC syndrome were included in the analysis. Eighty-six patients had one affected first-degree relative, and ten patients had two or more. Exome sequencing was utilized to search for genes harboring putative loss-of-function variants, because such alterations are likely candidates for disease-causing mutations. Eleven genes with rare truncating variants in two or three familial CRC cases were identified: UACA, SFXN4, TWSG1, PSPH, NUDT7, ZNF490, PRSS37, CCDC18, PRADC1, MRPL3, and AKR1C4. Loss of heterozygosity was examined in all respective cancer samples, and was detected in seven occasions involving four of the candidate genes. In all seven occasions the wild-type allele was lost (P = 0.0078) providing additional evidence that these eleven genes are likely to include true culprits. The study provides a set of candidate predisposition genes which may explain a subset of common familial CRC.

It is able to complete its life cycle in salinities close to freshwater (3 PSU) up to fully marine conditions (35 PSU) and is regarded as one of few truly brackish-water species. Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase (NAK) has been shown to be important for osmoregulation when marine organisms are challenged by changing salinities, and we therefore cloned and examined the expression of different NAKs from B. improvisus. We found two main gene variants, NAK1 and NAK2, which were approximately 70% identical at the protein level. The NAK1 mRNA existed in a long and short variant with the encoded proteins differing only by 27 N-terminal amino acids. This N-terminal stretch was coded for by a separate exon, and the two variants of NAK1 mRNAs appeared to be created by alternative splicing. We furthermore showed that the two NAK1 isoforms were differentially expressed in different life stages and in various tissues of adult barnacle, i.e the long isoform was predominant in cyprids and in adult cirri. In barnacle cyprid larvae that were exposed to a combination of different salinities and pCO2 levels, the expression of the long NAK1 mRNA increased relative to the short in low salinities. We suggest that the alternatively spliced long variant of the Nak1 protein might be of importance for osmoregulation in B. improvisus in low salinity conditions.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0077069", "pmid": "24130836", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-40484"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3793950"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KC357568"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KC357569"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "KC357570"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc5fe3e123854fb6b55ca080222083e0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/dc5fe3e123854fb6b55ca080222083e0"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "686aa4bcce6a41fba7fb74f8e6951f2f", "title": "Brain proteomics supports the role of glutamate metabolism and suggests other metabolic alterations in protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT)-knockout mice.", "authors": [{"family": "Yang", "given": "Hongqian", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lowenson", "given": "Jonathan D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Clarke", "given": "Steven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zubarev", "given": "Roman A", "initials": "RA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-10-04", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1535-3907", "issue": "10", "pages": "4566-4576", "title": "J.

These PIMT-knockout (PIMT-KO) mice have perturbed glutamate metabolism and die prematurely of epileptic seizures. To elucidate the role of PIMT further, brain proteomes of PIMT-KO mice and controls were analyzed. The isoAsp levels from two of the detected 67 isoAsp sites (residue 98 from calmodulin and 68 from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were quantified and found to be significantly increased in PIMT-KO mice (p < 0.01). Additionally, the abundance of at least 151 out of the 1017 quantified proteins was found to be altered in PIMT-KO mouse brains. Gene ontology analysis revealed that many down-regulated proteins are involved in cellular amino acid biosynthesis. For example, the serine synthesis pathway was suppressed, possibly leading to reduced serine production in PIMT-KO mice. Additionally, the abundances of enzymes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle were altered toward the accumulation of glutamate. These findings support the involvement of PIMT in glutamate metabolism and suggest that the absence of PIMT also affects other processes involving amino acid synthesis and metabolism.", "doi": "10.1021/pr400688r", "pmid": "23947766", "labels": {"Advanced Mass Spectrometry Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3818641"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS523577"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/686aa4bcce6a41fba7fb74f8e6951f2f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/686aa4bcce6a41fba7fb74f8e6951f2f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ecd33147407149de9276b0a5ad1a1889", "title": "Aneuploidy in neuroblastoma tumors is not associated with inactivating point mutations in the STAG2 gene.", "authors": [{"family": "Djos", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Fransson", "given": "Susanne", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kogner", "given": "Per", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Martinsson", "given": "Tommy", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-10-02", "journal": {"volume": "14", "issn": "1471-2350", "issue": null, "pages": "102", "title": "BMC Med.

Furthermore, it is possible that beta cells, by switching from full length to a truncated form of ZBED6, can decide the subcellular localization of ZBED6, thereby achieving differential ZBED6-mediated transcriptional regulation.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1303625110", "pmid": "24043816", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1303625110"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3791784"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b9bc7928871643598f2d013eada8cf22.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/b9bc7928871643598f2d013eada8cf22"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "04c2765944244265b5ee6785dee5925f", "title": "Profiling of atherosclerotic lesions by gene and tissue microarrays reveals PCSK6 as a novel protease in unstable carotid atherosclerosis.", "authors": [{"family": "Perisic", "given": "Ljubica", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hedin", "given": "Erika", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Razuvaev", "given": "Anton", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lengquist", "given": "Mariette", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Osterholm", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Folkersen", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Gillgren", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Paulsson-Berne", "given": "Gabrielle", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ponten", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Odeberg", "given": "Jacob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Hedin", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2013-10-00", "journal": {"volume": "33", "issn": "1524-4636", "issue": "10", "pages": "2432-2443", "title": "Arterioscler.

To identify pathogenetically important genetic rearrangements, 44 SFTs were analyzed using a variety of techniques. Chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed recurrent breakpoints in 12q13, clustering near the NAB2 and STAT6 genes, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis disclosed frequent deletions affecting STAT6. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed high expression levels of the 5'-end of NAB2 and the 3'-end of STAT6, which at deep sequencing of enriched DNA corresponded to NAB2/STAT6 fusions. Subsequent reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis identified a NAB2/STAT6 fusion in 37/41 cases, confirming that this fusion gene underlies the pathogenesis of SFT. The hypothesis that the NAB2/STAT6 fusions will result in altered properties of the transcriptional co-repressor NAB2--a key regulator of the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor - was corroborated by global gene expression analysis; SFTs showed deregulated expression of EGR1 target genes, as well as of other, developmentally important genes.

Actin nucleating formins have been implicated as key players in EMT. Here, we analysed which formins are altered in squamous cell carcinoma related EMT. FHOD1, a poorly studied formin, appeared to be markedly upregulated upon EMT. In human tissues FHOD1 was primarily expressed in mesenchymal cells, with little expression in epithelia. However, specimens from oral squamous cell cancers demonstrated consistent FHOD1 upregulation in mesenchymally transformed cells at the invasive edge. This upregulation was confirmed in an oral squamous carcinoma model, where FHOD1 expression was markedly increased upon EMT in a PI3K signalling dependent manner. In the EMT cells FHOD1 contributed to the spindle-shaped morphology and mesenchymal F-actin organization. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that FHOD1 contributes to cell migration and invasion. Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix. Our results indicate that FHOD1 participates in cytoskeletal changes in EMT.

An improved understanding of these changes through the development of experimental models may lead to improvements in existing clinical treatment options. The zebrafish is a well-established model for the study of skeletogenesis with significant potential in gerontological research. With advancing age, zebrafish frequently develop gross deformities of their vertebral column, previously ascribed to reduced trunk muscle tone. In this study, we assess degenerative changes specifically within the bone and cartilage of the vertebral column of zebrafish at 1, 2 and 3-years of age. We show increased frequency and severity of spinal deformities/curvatures with age. Underlying the most severe phenotypes are partial or complete vertebral dislocations and focal thickening of the vertebral bone at the joint margins. MicroCT examination demonstrates small defects, fractures and morphological evidence suggestive of bone erosion and remodeling (i.e. osteophytes) within the vertebrae during aging, but no significant change in bone density. Light and electron microscopic examination reveal striking age-related changes in cell morphology, suggestive of chondroptosis, and tissue remodelling of the vertebral cartilage, particularly within the pericellular micro-environment. Glycosaminoglycan analysis of the vertebral column by HPLC demonstrates a consistent, age-related increase in the yield of total chondroitin sulfate disaccharide, but no change in sulfation pattern, supported by immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry strongly identifies all three chondroitin/dermatan sulphate isoforms (C-0-S, C-4-S/DS and C-6-S) within the vertebral cartilage, particularly within the pericellular micro-environment. In contrast, keratan sulfate immunolocalises specifically with the notochordal tissue of the intervertebral disc, and its labelling diminishes with age.

The phenotype of heterozygous horses is less severe and predominantly includes iridociliary cysts, which occasionally extend into the temporal retina.

Our census also reveals enrichment in genetic prerequisites for a copiotrophic lifestyle and resistance mechanisms reflecting adaptation to prevalent eutrophic conditions and the accumulation of environmental pollutants resulting from ongoing anthropogenic pressures in the Baltic Sea.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0074983", "pmid": "24086414", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-13-23027"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3781128"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a59fc855052c46eabd6c08e2a220e98b.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/a59fc855052c46eabd6c08e2a220e98b"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f860b4e98f3044179bb6ac075c1296ff", "title": "Ebsulfur Is a Benzisothiazolone Cytocidal Inhibitor Targeting the Trypanothione Reductase ofTrypanosoma brucei", "authors": [{"family": "Lu", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Vodnala", "given": "Suman K", "initials": "SK"}, {"family": "Gustavsson", "given": "Anna Lena", "initials": "AL"}, {"family": "Gustafsson", "given": "Tomas N", "initials": "TN"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6berg", "given": "Birger", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Henrik A", "initials": "HA"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Sangit", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Tjernberg", "given": "Agneta", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Engman", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rottenberg", "given": "Martin E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "Holmgren", "given": "Arne", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2013-09-20", "journal": {"volume": "288", "issn": "1083-351X", "issue": "38", "pages": "27456-27468", "title": "J.

The diplomonad parasite Giardia intestinalis harbours mitosomes, another type of MRO. Here we identify MROs in the salmon parasite Spironucleus salmonicida with similar protein import and Fe-S cluster assembly machineries as in Giardia mitosomes. We find that hydrogen production is prevalent in the diplomonad genus Spironucleus, and that S. salmonicida MROs contain enzymes characteristic of hydrogenosomes. Evolutionary analyses of known hydrogenosomal components indicate their presence in the diplomonad ancestor, and subsequent loss in Giardia.

These discoveries have already had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the genetic architecture of these diseases and have directed functional studies that have revealed some of the biological functions that are important to IBD (e.g. autophagy). Nonetheless, these loci can only explain a small proportion of disease variance (~14% in CD and 7.5% in UC), suggesting that not only are additional loci to be found but that the known loci may contain high effect rare risk variants that have gone undetected by GWAS. To test this, we have used a targeted sequencing approach in 200 UC cases and 150 healthy controls (HC), all of French Canadian descent, to study 55 genes in regions associated with UC. We performed follow-up genotyping of 42 rare non-synonymous variants in independent case-control cohorts (totaling 14,435 UC cases and 20,204 HC). Our results confirmed significant association to rare non-synonymous coding variants in both IL23R and CARD9, previously identified from sequencing of CD loci, as well as identified a novel association in RNF186. With the exception of CARD9 (OR = 0.39), the rare non-synonymous variants identified were of moderate effect (OR = 1.49 for RNF186 and OR = 0.79 for IL23R). RNF186 encodes a protein with a RING domain having predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and two transmembrane domains.

Gene activation by potent NF-\u03baB transcription factors is essential both in mammals and Drosophila during infection and stress challenges. If not strictly controlled, this potent defense system can activate autoimmune and inflammatory stress reactions, with deleterious consequences for the organism. Negative regulation to prevent gene activation in healthy organisms, in the presence of the commensal gut flora, is however not well understood.\n\nWe show that the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Oct1/POU2F1 transcription factor, called Nubbin (Nub), is a repressor of NF-\u03baB/Relish-driven antimicrobial peptide gene expression in flies. In nub1 mutants, which lack Nub-PD protein, excessive expression of antimicrobial peptide genes occurs in the absence of infection, leading to a significant reduction of the numbers of cultivatable gut commensal bacteria. This aberrant immune gene expression was effectively blocked by expression of Nub from a transgene. We have identified an upstream regulatory region, containing a cluster of octamer sites, which is required for repression of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in healthy flies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Nub binds to octamer-containing promoter fragments of several immune genes. Gene expression profiling revealed that Drosophila Nub negatively regulates many genes that are involved in immune and stress responses, while it is a positive regulator of genes involved in differentiation and metabolism.\n\nThis study demonstrates that a large number of genes that are activated by NF-\u03baB/Relish in response to infection are normally repressed by the evolutionarily conserved Oct/POU transcription factor Nub. This prevents uncontrolled gene activation and supports the existence of a normal gut flora.

For example, variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) with embedded enhancers have been shown to regulate gene transcription. The post-zygotic variation is the presence of genetically distinct populations of cells in an individual derived from a single zygote, and this is an understudied aspect of genome biology. We report somatically variable VNTR with sequence properties of an enhancer, located upstream of IFNAR1. Initially, SNP genotyping of 63 monozygotic twin pairs and multiple tissues from 21 breast cancer patients suggested a frequent post-zygotic mosaicism. The VNTR displayed a repeated 32 bp core motif in the center of the repeat, which was flanked by similar variable motifs. A total of 14 alleles were characterized based on combinations of segments, which showed post-zygotic and inter-individual variation, with up to 6 alleles in a single subject. Somatic variation occurred in \u223c24% of cases. In this hypervariable region, we found a clustering of transcription factor binding sites with strongest sequence similarity to mouse Foxg1 transcription factor binding motif. This study describes a VNTR with sequence properties of an enhancer that displays post-zygotic and inter-individual genetic variation. This element is within a locus containing four related cytokine receptors: IFNAR2, IL10R\u03b2, IFNAR1 and IFNGR2, and we hypothesize that it might function in transcriptional regulation of several genes in this cluster.

Here we performed the first genome-wide methylation profiling of SMA patients and healthy individuals to study the association of DNA methylation status with the severity of the SMA phenotype. We identified strong significant differences in methylation level between SMA patients and healthy controls in CpG sites close to the genes CHML, ARHGAP22, CYTSB, CDK2AP1 and SLC23A2. Interestingly, the CHML and ARHGAP22 genes are associated with the activity of Rab and Rho GTPases, which are important regulators of vesicle formation, actin dynamics, axonogenesis, processes that could be critical for SMA development. We suggest that epigenetic modifications may influence the severity of SMA and that these novel genetic positions could prove to be valuable biomarkers for the understanding of SMA pathogenesis.",

Sufficiently powered and family-based association studies of glutamatergic and GABAergic genes with suicidal behavior are nonexistent, but several studies have been reported for polyamines. We therefore conducted, for the first time ever, an extensive family-based study of 113 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 24 glutamatergic and GABA genes, in addition to interrelated polyaminergic genes, on the outcome of severe suicide attempts (SAs). The family-based analysis (n=660 trios) was supplemented with gene-environment interaction (G \u00d7 E), case-control (n=519 controls) and subgroup analyses. The main observations were the previously unreported association and linkage of SNPs rs2268115 and rs220557 in GRIN2B, as well as of SNPs rs1049500 and rs2302614 in ODC1 (P<10(-2)). Furthermore, GRIN2B haplotypic associations were observed, in particular with a four-SNP AGGC haplotype (rs1805247-rs1806201-rs1805482-rs2268115; P<10(-5)), and a third SNP rs7559979 in ODC1 showed G \u00d7 E with serious childhood/adolescent physical assault (P<10(-4)). SA subjects were characterized by transdiagnostic trait anger and past year alcohol-drug use disorders, but not by alcohol-drug use at SA, depression, anxiety or psychosis diagnoses. We also discuss a first ever confirmatory observation of SNP rs6526342 (polyaminergic SAT1) in SA, originally identified in completed suicides.

The present study aims to investigate if serum levels of dioxin and other persistent environmental pollutants are related to global DNA methylation in a human sample. In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (all aged 70), global DNA methylation was measured by the Luminometric Methylation Assay in 524 subjects. Twenty-three different POPs, including 16 PCBs, five pesticides, one dioxin (OCDD) and one brominated flame retardant (BDE47) were analysed by HRGC/HRMS. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Aryl hydrocarbon (Ah)-receptor were analysed by mini-sequencing. High levels of toxic equivalency (TEQ) for PCBs and dioxin were associated with DNA hypermethylation (p=0.030). This was mainly attributed to coplanar non-ortho PCBs. While no significant associations were found between DNA methylation and SNPs in the Ah-receptor, an interaction was found between the SNP rs2237297 and TEQ so that TEQ was associated with hypermethylation (p=0.009) only in subjects with one G-allele (n=103). Also high levels of the PCB126 congener, the OCDD, and the pesticide metabolite p,p'-DDE were related to DNA hypermethylation (p=0.01, 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, in a sample of elderly subjects, high TEQ including PCBs and the dioxin OCDD and high serum levels of PCB126, OCDD, and p,p'-DDE were related to global DNA hypermethylation in a cross-sectional analysis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2013.07.008", "pmid": "23933504", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0160-4120(13)00152-9"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f7e5cebc7cd645fa92a27650fe79b2c9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/f7e5cebc7cd645fa92a27650fe79b2c9"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "783c318d16164bebb17391a256efe62c", "title": "Comparison of the nodule vs. root transcriptome of the actinorhizal plant Datisca glomerata: actinorhizal nodules contain a specific class of defensins.", "authors": [{"family": "Demina", "given": "Irina V", "initials": "IV"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Santos", "given": "Patricia", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Plaszczyca", "given": "Marian", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pawlowski", "given": "Katharina", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-08-29", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "8", "pages": "e72442", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Actinorhizal root nodule symbioses are very diverse, and the symbiosis of Datisca glomerata has previously been shown to have many unusual aspects.

Root and nodule libraries representing the 3'-ends of cDNAs were subjected to high-throughput parallel 454 sequencing. To identify the corresponding genes and to improve the assembly, Illumina sequencing of the nodule transcriptome was performed as well. The evaluation revealed 406 differentially regulated genes, 295 of which (72.7%) could be assigned a function based on homology. Analysis of the nodule transcriptome showed that genes encoding components of the common symbiosis signaling pathway were present in nodules of D. glomerata, which in combination with the previously established function of SymRK in D. glomerata nodulation suggests that this pathway is also active in actinorhizal Cucurbitales. Furthermore, comparison of the D. glomerata nodule transcriptome with nodule transcriptomes from actinorhizal Fagales revealed a new subgroup of nodule-specific defensins that might play a role specific to actinorhizal symbioses.

Many of the most strongly induced genes have been implicated in immune responses in other infection models. Mapping of the complete set of differentially regulated genes showed the hallmarks of a wound response, but also identified a large fraction of EPN-specific transcripts. Several genes identified by transcriptome profiling or their homologues play protective roles during nematode infections. Genes that positively contribute to controlling nematobacterial infections encode: a homolog of thioester-containing complement protein 3, a basement membrane component (glutactin), a recognition protein (GNBP-like 3) and possibly several small peptides. Of note is that several of these genes have not previously been implicated in immune responses.", "doi": "10.1159/000353734", "pmid": "23988573", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "000353734"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5165d78ca9f243f09656046db2957cec.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5165d78ca9f243f09656046db2957cec"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "798604e143a640fdb25e6d793786aa4b", "title": "Structure-Guided Design of Novel Thiazolidine Inhibitors ofO-Acetyl Serine Sulfhydrylase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "authors": [{"family": "Poyraz", "given": "\u00d6mer", "initials": "\u00d6"}, {"family": "Jeankumar", "given": "Variam Ullas", "initials": "VU"}, {"family": "Saxena", "given": "Shalini", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Schnell", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Haraldsson", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Yogeeswari", "given": "Perumal", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Sriram", "given": "Dharmarajan", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Gunter", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2013-08-22", "journal": {"volume": "56", "issn": "1520-4804", "issue": "16", "pages": "6457-6466", "title": "J.

Although multiple Treponema phylotypes may exist in ulcerative lesions in pigs, T. pedis appears to be a predominant spirochete in these lesions. Treponema pedis can also be present in pig gingiva. In this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of T. pedis strain T A4, isolated from a porcine necrotic ear lesion, and compared its genome with that of T. denticola. Most genes in T. pedis were homologous to those in T. denticola and the two species were similar in general genomic features such as size, G+C content, and number of genes. In addition, many homologues of specific virulence-related genes in T. denticola were found in T. pedis. Comparing a selected pair of strains will usually not give a complete picture of the relatedness between two species. We therefore complemented the analysis with draft genomes from six T. pedis isolates, originating from gingiva and necrotic ulcers in pigs, and from twelve T. denticola strains. Each strain carried a considerable amount of accessory genetic material, of which a large part was strain specific. There was also extensive sequence variability in putative virulence-related genes between strains belonging to the same species.

There is a growing recognition that identifying \"causal\" rare variants also requires large-scale meta-analysis. The fact that association tests with rare variants are performed at the gene level rather than at the variant level poses unprecedented challenges in the meta-analysis. First, different studies may adopt different gene-level tests, so the results are not compatible. Second, gene-level tests require multivariate statistics (i.e., components of the test statistic and their covariance matrix), which are difficult to obtain. To overcome these challenges, we propose to perform gene-level tests for rare variants by combining the results of single-variant analysis (i.e., p values of association tests and effect estimates) from participating studies. This simple strategy is possible because of an insight that multivariate statistics can be recovered from single-variant statistics, together with the correlation matrix of the single-variant test statistics, which can be estimated from one of the participating studies or from a publicly available database. We show both theoretically and numerically that the proposed meta-analysis approach provides accurate control of the type I error and is as powerful as joint analysis of individual participant data.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The current basis for diagnosis and prognosis in urinary bladder cancer is based on the pathologists' assessment of a biopsy of the tumour. Urinary biomarkers are preferable as they can be non-invasively sampled. Urinary cytology is the only test with widespread use but is hampered by poor reproducibility and low sensitivity. By studying the protein expression in bladder tumour tissue samples of proteins previously found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with bladder cancer, we have been able to show that these proteins originate from the tumour. The immunoreactivity of three of the investigated proteins increased with higher stage. Also a serine peptidase inhibitor was found to be predictive of progression from non-muscle-invasive to muscle-invasive tumours.\n\nTo analyse the expression of five bladder cancer-associated urinary proteins and investigate if expression is related to the malignant phenotype of the tumour. To explore the possible prognostic value of these proteins.\n\nUrine samples, 16 from patients with bladder cancer and 26 from controls, were used in Western Blotting experiments. Tissue microarrays with bladder tissue from 344 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer between 1984 and 2005 was used in immunohistochemistry experiments. The proteins apolipoprotein E (APOE), fibrinogen \u03b2 chain precursor (FGB), leucine-rich \u03b12-glycoprotein (LRG1), polymerase (RNA) I polypeptide E (POLR1E), \u03b11-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) and topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) were probed with antibodies validated by the Human Protein Atlas.\n\nIncreased expressions of APOE, FGB and POLR1E were correlated with increased tumour stage (P < 0.001).

The corresponding requirements for the precision of proteomics analysis are high, and this often poses a challenge, especially when employing label-free quantification. One of the main contributors to the inaccuracy of label-free proteomics experiments is the variability of the instrumental response during LC-MS/MS runs. Such variability might include fluctuations in the electrospray current, transmission efficiency from the air-vacuum interface to the detector, and detection sensitivity. We have developed an in silico post-processing method of reducing these variations, and have thus significantly improved the precision of label-free proteomics analysis. For abundant blood plasma proteins, a coefficient of variation of approximately 1% was achieved, which allowed for sex differentiation in pooled samples and \u224890% accurate differentiation of individual samples by means of a single LC-MS/MS analysis.

To better understand the cellular functions of adhesive traps, the trap cell proteome of the fungus Monacrosporium haptotylum was characterized. The trap of M. haptotylum consists of a unicellular structure called a knob that develops at the apex of a hypha. Proteins extracted from knobs and mycelia were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The peptide sequences were matched against predicted gene models from the recently sequenced M. haptotylum genome. In total, 336 proteins were identified, with 54 expressed at significantly higher levels in the knobs than in the mycelia. The upregulated knob proteins included peptidases, small secreted proteins with unknown functions, and putative cell surface adhesins containing carbohydrate-binding domains, including the WSC domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all upregulated WSC domain proteins belonged to a large, expanded cluster of paralogs in M. haptotylum. Several peptidases and homologs of experimentally verified proteins in other pathogenic fungi were also upregulated in the knob proteome. Complementary profiling of gene expression at the transcriptome level showed poor correlation between the upregulation of knob proteins and their corresponding transcripts.

Although little is known about the underlying genetics, growth variability during puberty correlates with adult risks for hormone-dependent cancer and adverse cardiometabolic health. The only gene so far associated with pubertal height growth, LIN28B, pleiotropically influences childhood growth, puberty and cancer progression, pointing to shared underlying mechanisms. To discover genetic loci influencing pubertal height and growth and to place them in context of overall growth and maturation, we performed genome-wide association meta-analyses in 18 737 European samples utilizing longitudinally collected height measurements. We found significant associations (P < 1.67 \u00d7 10(-8)) at 10 loci, including LIN28B. Five loci associated with pubertal timing, all impacting multiple aspects of growth. In particular, a novel variant correlated with expression of MAPK3, and associated both with increased prepubertal growth and earlier menarche. Another variant near ADCY3-POMC associated with increased body mass index, reduced pubertal growth and earlier puberty. Whereas epidemiological correlations suggest that early puberty marks a pathway from rapid prepubertal growth to reduced final height and adult obesity, our study shows that individual loci associating with pubertal growth have variable longitudinal growth patterns that may differ from epidemiological observations. Overall, this study uncovers part of the complex genetic architecture linking pubertal height growth, the timing of puberty and childhood obesity and provides new information to pinpoint processes linking these traits.", "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddt104", "pmid": "23449627", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": "Service"}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ddt104"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3674797"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/adaf08f7cdf54005af3210ec5aa6aa34.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/adaf08f7cdf54005af3210ec5aa6aa34"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "053dcdf7a470487bbc007fafb09de734", "title": "Active nitrogen-fixing heterotrophic bacteria at and below the chemocline of the central Baltic Sea.", "authors": [{"family": "Farnelid", "given": "Hanna", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bentzon-Tilia", "given": "Mikkel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Anders F", "initials": "AF"}, {"family": "Bertilsson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Jost", "given": "G\u00fcnter", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Labrenz", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "J\u00fcrgens", "given": "Klaus", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Riemann", "given": "Lasse", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "7", "issn": "1751-7370", "issue": "7", "pages": "1413-1423", "title": "ISME J"}, "abstract": "The Baltic Sea receives large nitrogen inputs by diazotrophic (N2-fixing) heterocystous cyanobacteria but the significance of heterotrophic N2 fixation has not been studied.

The remaining portion of disease aetiology has been conventionally ascribed to environmental effects, with an unknown part being stochastic. This review focuses on recent studies highlighting stochastic events of potentially great importance in human disease-the accumulation of post-zygotic structural aberrations with age in phenotypically normal humans. These findings are in agreement with a substantial mutational load predicted to occur during lifetime within the human soma. A major consequence of these results is that the genetic profile of a single tissue collected at one time point should be used with caution as a faithful portrait of other tissues from the same subject or the same tissue throughout life. Thus, the design of studies in human genetics interrogating a single sample per subject or applying lymphoblastoid cell lines may come into question. Sporadic disorders are common in medicine. We wish to stress the non-heritable genetic variation as a potentially important factor behind the development of sporadic diseases. Moreover, associations between post-zygotic mutations, clonal cell expansions and their relation to cancer predisposition are central in this context. Post-zygotic mutations are amenable to robust examination and are likely to explain a sizable part of non-heritable disease causality, which has routinely been thought of as synonymous with environmental factors. In view of the widespread accumulation of genetic aberrations with age and strong predictions of disease risk from such analyses, studies of post-zygotic mutations may be a fruitful approach for delineation of variants that are causative for common human disorders.", "doi": "10.1136/postgradmedj-2012-101322rep", "pmid": "23781115", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "postgradmedj-2012-101322rep"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3711362"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/30ad36931bf84a5796ba662da42ac3a8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/30ad36931bf84a5796ba662da42ac3a8"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5130693ce09f4fe0b874c25e95858efd", "title": "Computational Prospecting for Drug\u2013Transporter Interactions", "authors": [{"family": "Matsson", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Artursson", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2013-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "94", "issn": "0009-9236", "issue": "1", "pages": "30-32", "title": "Clin Pharmacol Ther"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/clpt.2013.67", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)": "Technology development"}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5130693ce09f4fe0b874c25e95858efd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5130693ce09f4fe0b874c25e95858efd"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "605f4a936bcb4643ab7978a8d82e0c9a", "title": "Massive functional mapping of a 5'-UTR by saturation mutagenesis, phenotypic sorting and deep sequencing.", "authors": [{"family": "Holmqvist", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Reimeg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Wagner", "given": "E Gerhart H", "initials": "EG"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-07-00", "journal": {"volume": "41", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "12", "pages": "e122", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "We present here a method that enables functional screening of large number of mutations in a single experiment through the combination of random mutagenesis, phenotypic cell sorting and high-throughput sequencing.

A 109 bp sequence within the csgD 5'-UTR, containing all elements for expression and sRNA-dependent control, was mutagenized close to saturation. We monitored expression from a translational gfp fusion and collected fractions of cells with distinct expression levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value <0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. DNA methylation sites that are located within CpG islands (CGIs) more often become hypermethylated compared to sites outside an island. CpG sites in promoters are more unaffected by age, whereas sites in enhancers more often becomes hypo- or hypermethylated.

However, the exact function of the protein is not known, and it shares very low sequence identity with proteins of known structure or function. Here we present the structure of the full lumenal domain of Erv41p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0\u00c5. The structure reveals the protein to be composed predominantly of two large \u03b2-sheets that form a twisted \u03b2-sandwich. Comparison to structures in the Protein Data Bank shows that the Erv41p lumenal domain displays only limited similarity to \u03b2-sandwich domains of other proteins. Analysis of the surface properties of the protein identifies an extensive patch of negative electrostatic potential on the exposed surface of one of the \u03b2-sheets, which likely forms a binding site for a ligand or interaction partner. A predominantly hydrophobic region close to the membrane interface is identified as a likely site for protein-protein interaction. This structure, the first of Erv41p or any of its homologues, provides a new starting point for studies of the roles of Erv41p and its interaction partners in the eukaryotic secretory pathway.",

between adiposity and cardiometabolic traits is well known from epidemiological studies. Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach.\r\n\r\nWe used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n\u200a =\u200a 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p < 0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p < 0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p\u200a = \u200a0.001).\r\n\r\nWe provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1001474", "pmid": "23824655", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PMEDICINE-D-12-03573"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3692470"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c2744079070a474986d37354abb62585.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c2744079070a474986d37354abb62585"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ef809a1996704838a59705082f7f5b37", "title": "Lessons learned from implementing a national infrastructure in Sweden for storage and analysis of next-generation sequencing data.", "authors": [{"family": "Lampa", "given": "Samuel", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Dahl\u00f6", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Olason", "given": "Pall I", "initials": "PI"}, {"family": "Hagberg", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Spjuth", "given": "Ola", "initials": "O"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-06-25", "journal": {"volume": "2", "issn": "2047-217X", "issue": "1", "pages": "9", "title": "Gigascience"}, "abstract": ": Analyzing and storing data and results from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments is a challenging task, hampered by ever-increasing data volumes and frequent updates of analysis methods and tools.

Here we describe UPPNEX, an implementation of such an infrastructure, tailored to the needs of data storage and analysis of NGS data in Sweden serving various labs and multiple instruments from the major sequencing technology platforms. UPPNEX comprises resources for high-performance computing, large-scale and high-availability storage, an extensive bioinformatics software suite, up-to-date reference genomes and annotations, a support function with system and application experts as well as a web portal and support ticket system. UPPNEX applications are numerous and diverse, and include whole genome-, de novo- and exome sequencing, targeted resequencing, SNP discovery, RNASeq, and methylation analysis. There are over 300 projects that utilize UPPNEX and include large undertakings such as the sequencing of the flycatcher and Norwegian spruce. We describe the strategic decisions made when investing in hardware, setting up maintenance and support, allocating resources, and illustrate major challenges such as managing data growth. We conclude with summarizing our experiences and observations with UPPNEX to date, providing insights into the successful and less successful decisions made.", "doi": "10.1186/2047-217X-2-9", "pmid": "23800020", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2047-217X-2-9"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3704847"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ef809a1996704838a59705082f7f5b37.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/ef809a1996704838a59705082f7f5b37"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7ef6e8359a244573a60a04db1afe077c", "title": "Substrate Channel Flexibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurB Accommodates Two Distinct Substrates.", "authors": [{"family": "Chen", "given": "Ming Wei", "initials": "MW"}, {"family": "Lohkamp", "given": "Bernhard", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Schnell", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Lescar", "given": "Julien", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Gunter", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-06-21", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "6", "pages": "e66936", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid in bacteria is a committed step towards peptidoglycan production. In an NADPH- and FAD-dependent reaction, the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate reductase (MurB) reduces UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. We determined the three-dimensional structures of the ternary complex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurB with FAD and NADP(+) in two crystal forms to resolutions of 2.2 and 2.1 \u00c5, respectively, to investigate the structural basis of the first half-reaction, hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD. The nicotinamide ring of NADP(+) stacks against the si face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, suggesting an unusual mode of hydride transfer to flavin. Comparison with the structure of the Escherichia coli MurB complex with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate shows that both substrates share the binding site located between two lobes of the substrate-binding domain III, consistent with a ping pong mechanism with sequential substrate binding. The nicotinamide and the enolpyruvyl moieties are strikingly well-aligned upon superimposition, both positioned for hydride transfer to and from FAD. However, flexibility of the substrate channel allows the non-reactive parts of the two substrates to bind in different conformations. A potassium ion in the active site may assist in substrate orientation and binding. These structural models should help in structure-aided drug design against MurB, which is essential for cell wall biogenesis and hence bacterial survival.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066936",

The aim of this study was to analyze the significance of using p38 MAPK phosphorylation as a prognostic marker in high-grade glioma patients and as a therapeutic target in combination chemotherapy with vandetanib. p38 MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed with immunohistochemistry in 90 high-grade glioma patients. Correlation between p38 MAPK phosphorylation and overall survival was analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test analysis. The effects on survival of glioblastoma cells of combining vandetanib with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 were analyzed in vitro with the median-effect method with the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay. Two patients had phosphorylated p38 MAPK in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and these two presented with worse survival than patients with no detectable p38 MAPK phosphorylation or phosphorylated p38 MAPK only in the nucleus. This was true for both high-grade glioma patients (WHO grade III and IV, n = 90, difference in median survival: 6.1 months, 95 % CI [0.20, 23], p = 0.039) and for the subgroup with glioblastoma patients (WHO grade IV, n = 70, difference in median survival: 6.1 months, 95 % CI [0.066, 23], p = 0.043). The combination of vandetanib and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 had synergistic effects on cell survival for glioblastoma-derived cells in vitro.

However, not all pigs in a pen perform or receive tail biting behaviour and it has recently been shown that these 'neutral' pigs not only differ in their behaviour, but also in their gene expression compared to performers and receivers of tail biting in the same pen. To investigate whether this difference was linked to the cause or a consequence of them not being involved in the outbreak of tail biting, behaviour and brain gene expression was compared with 'control' pigs housed in pens with no tail biting. It was shown that the pigs housed in control pens performed a wider variety of pig-directed abnormal behaviour (belly nosing 0.95\u00b11.59, tail in mouth 0.31\u00b10.60 and 'other' abnormal 1.53\u00b14.26; mean\u00b1S.D) compared to the neutral pigs (belly nosing 0.30\u00b10.62, tail in mouth 0.13\u00b10.50 and \"other\" abnormal 0.42\u00b11.06). With Affymetrix gene expression arrays, 107 transcripts were identified as differently expressed (p<0.05) between these two categories of pigs. Several of these transcripts had already been shown to be differently expressed in the neutral pigs when they were compared to performers and receivers of tail biting in the same pen in an earlier study. Hence, the different expression of these genes cannot be a consequence of the neutral pigs not being involved in tail biting behaviour, but rather linked to the cause contributing to why they were not involved in tail biting interactions.

Despite massive improvement in instrumentation, sample prefractionation is still needed to reduce sample complexity and improve proteome coverage. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) has been traditionally used as a first-dimension protein separation technique in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics. Recently, peptide IEF has emerged as appealing alternative for anion exchange chromatography in multidimensional LC-MS/MS workflows. The rationale behind using narrow-range peptide isoelectric focusing as a prefractionation method prior to ms/ms is to reduce the complexity induced by tryptic digestion. This is done by selectively analyzing a sub-fraction of peptides with an acidic pI. The pI range is chosen as it has previously been shown that 96 % of human proteins have at least one tryptic peptide between pH 3.4 and 4.9. This ensures high proteome coverage while reducing the number of peptides with 2/3. In addition the focusing precision is optimal in this range. Therefore, by analyzing this sub-fraction of peptides the complexity of the sample can be reduced without significant loss of proteome coverage. As the theoretical pI of peptides can be calculated, the pI of the identified peptides can be used to validate the peptide sequence (identified peptides with pI outside the pH range 3.4-4.9 are more likely to be false positives). In addition, this approach is compatible with iTRAQ labelling as the different iTRAQ labels migrate similarly in IEF.", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-7209-4_1", "pmid": "23765616", "labels": {"Clinical Proteomics Mass spectrometry": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1fe44fabcf483abdd700396ed83d4e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1fe44fabcf483abdd700396ed83d4e"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2e42e8d0491849e18636a9542a65ef10", "title": "Protein quantification by peptide quality control (PQPQ) of shotgun proteomics data.", "authors": [{"family": "Forshed", "given": "Jenny", "initials": "J"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-06-15", "journal": {"volume": "1023", "issn": "1940-6029", "issue": null, "pages": "149-158", "title": "Methods Mol.

The method is based on the assumption that the quantitative pattern of peptides derived from one protein will correlate over several samples. Dissonant patterns are assumed to arise either from mismatched peptides or due to the presence of different protein species. PQPQ identifies and excludes outliers and detects the existence of different protein species by correlation analysis. Alternative protein species can then be quantified separately. PQPQ can handle shotgun proteomics data from several MS instruments, data from different kinds of labeling, and label-free data. We have previously shown that data processing by PQPQ improves the information output from shotgun proteomics by validating the algorithm on seven datasets related to different cancer studies (Forshed et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 10(10):M111.010264, 2011). Data from two labeling procedures and three different instrumental platforms was included in the evaluation. With this unique method using both peptide sequence data and quantitative data, we can improve the quantitative accuracy and precision on the protein level and detect different protein species (Forshed et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 10(10):M111.010264, 2011).", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-7209-4_9", "pmid": "23765624", "labels": {"Clinical Proteomics Mass spectrometry": null}, "xrefs": [], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2e42e8d0491849e18636a9542a65ef10.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/2e42e8d0491849e18636a9542a65ef10"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "afd562f281744bc99a19b35dbd0c972d", "title": "Comprehensive analysis of MHC ligands in clinical material by immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry.", "authors": [{"family": "Kasuga", "given": "Kie", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-06-15", "journal": {"volume": "1023", "issn": "1940-6029", "issue": null, "pages": "203-218", "title": "Methods Mol.

Therefore, the importance of comprehensive analysis of MHC ligands is increasing. Mass spectrometry has been the core technology of ligand identification since the 1990s.

As an alternative to planar arrays, a system based on color-coded beads for the creation of antibody arrays in suspension has become available to offer a microtiter plate-based option for screening larger number of samples with variable sets of capture reagents.

The assay is an enhancement of the original proximity ligation assay, and it is based on using proximity probes labeled with unique tag sequences that can be used to read out which probes, from a pool of probes, have bound a certain protein complex. Using this approach, it is possible to gain information on the constituents of different protein complexes, the subcellular location of the complexes, and how the balance between different complex constituents can change between normal and malignant cells, for example. As a proof of concept, we used the assay to simultaneously visualize multiple protein complexes involving EGFR, HER2, and HER3 homo- and heterodimers on a single-cell level in breast cancer tissue sections.

Experimental downregulation of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio identified 20 genes at 11 loci that are relevant for heart rate regulation and highlight a role for genes involved in signal transmission, embryonic cardiac development and the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, congenital heart failure and/or sudden cardiac death. In addition, genetic susceptibility to increased heart rate is associated with altered cardiac conduction and reduced risk of sick sinus syndrome, and both heart rate-increasing and heart rate-decreasing variants associate with risk of atrial fibrillation.

Patients were genotyped on a custom 12k Illumina Array. The allele frequencies were compared between patients with (n=66) and without (n=509) CHD.

Comparative studies of sRNAs from plants have mainly focused on miRNA, even though they constitute a mere fraction of the total sRNA diversity. In this study, we report results from an in-depth analysis of the sRNA population from the conifer spruce (Picea abies) and compared the results with those of a range of plant species. The vast majority of sRNA sequences in spruce can be assigned to 21-nucleotide-long siRNA sequences, of which a large fraction originate from the degradation of transcribed sequences related to nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat-type resistance genes. Over 90% of all genes predicted to contain either a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor or nucleotide-binding site domain showed evidence of siRNA degradation. The data further suggest that this phased degradation of resistance-related genes is initiated from miRNA-guided cleavage, often by an abundant 22-nucleotide miRNA. Comparative analysis over a range of plant species revealed a huge variation in the abundance of this phenomenon. The process seemed to be virtually absent in several species, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and nonvascular plants, while particularly high frequencies were observed in spruce, grape (Vitis vinifera), and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). This divergent pattern might reflect a mechanism to limit runaway transcription of these genes in species with rapidly expanding nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat gene families. Alternatively, it might reflect variation in a counter-counter defense mechanism between plant species.", "doi": "10.1104/pp.113.214643", "pmid": "23580593", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "pp.113.214643"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3668067"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "ACN49932"}, {"db": "GENBANK", "key": "TC161203"}, {"db": "GEO", "key": "GSE28755"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/335fdcd40a9747538176a8109141ebe6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/335fdcd40a9747538176a8109141ebe6"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "38deb04ab67148e9bfa7ba2cd6bbf4eb", "title": "Initial quantitative proteomic map of 28 mouse tissues using the SILAC mouse.", "authors": [{"family": "Geiger", "given": "Tamar", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Velic", "given": "Ana", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Macek", "given": "Boris", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lundberg", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kampf", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Nagaraj", "given": "Nagarjuna", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Cox", "given": "Juergen", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mann", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-06-00", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1535-9484", "issue": "6", "pages": "1709-1722", "title": "Mol.

In particular, global and quantitative analysis of the proteome of mammalian tissues would point to tissue-specific mechanisms and place the function of each protein in a whole-organism perspective. We performed proteomic analyses of 28 mouse tissues using high-resolution mass spectrometry and used a mix of mouse tissues labeled via stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture as a \"spike-in\" internal standard for accurate protein quantification across these tissues. We identified a total of 7,349 proteins and quantified 6,974 of them. Bioinformatic data analysis showed that physiologically related tissues clustered together and that highly expressed proteins represented the characteristic tissue functions. Tissue specialization was reflected prominently in the proteomic profiles and is apparent already in their hundred most abundant proteins. The proportion of strictly tissue-specific proteins appeared to be small.

In summary, four in vitro testing strategies were proposed as best performing in terms of predictive capacity with respect to the European acute oral toxicity classification.

The aims of this study were to explore the glacial and postglacial history of T.\u00a0pinivora, and add to the understanding of its current distribution and level of contemporary gene flow. We surveyed published records of its occurrence and analysed individuals from a representative subset of populations across the range. A 633\u00a0bp long fragment of the mtDNA COI gene was sequenced and nine polymorphic microsatellite loci were genotyped. Only nine nucleotide sites were polymorphic in the COI gene and 90% of the individuals from across its whole range shared the same haplotype. The microsatellite diversity gradually declined towards the north, and unique alleles were found in only three of the northern and three of southern sites. Genetic structuring did not indicate complete isolation among regions, but an increase of genetic isolation by geographic distance. Approximate Bayesian model choice suggested recent divergence during the postglacial period, but glacial refugia remain unidentified.

Sex-differences were apparent only for waist phenotypes, not for height, weight, BMI, or hip circumference. Moreover, we found no evidence for genetic effects with opposite directions in men versus women. The PPARG locus is of specific interest due to its role in diabetes genetics and therapy.

Opin. Struct. Biol."}, "abstract": "Many proteins are composed of protein domains, functional units of common descent. Multidomain forms are common in all eukaryotes making up more than half of the proteome and the evolution of novel domain architecture has been accelerated in metazoans. It is also becoming increasingly clear that alternative splicing is prevalent among vertebrates. Given that protein domains are defined as structurally, functionally and evolutionarily distinct units, one may speculate that some alternative splicing events may lead to clean excisions of protein domains, thus generating a number of different domain architectures from one gene template. However, recent findings indicate that smaller alternative splicing events, in particular in disordered regions, might be more prominent than domain architectural changes.

In this study, we reconstructed the genome and metabolic potential of the abundant Baltic Sea Spartobacteria phylotype by metagenomics.

Notably, we found 23 glycoside hydrolases that likely allow the use of a variety of carbohydrates, like cellulose, mannan, xylan, chitin, and starch, as carbon sources. In addition, a complete pathway for sulfate utilization was found, indicating catabolic processing of sulfated polysaccharides, commonly found in aquatic phytoplankton. The high frequency of glycoside hydrolase genes implies an important role of this organism in the aquatic carbon cycle.

Here, we provide a possible explanation for the IF-like function of FilP by demonstrating its ability to self-assemble into a cis-interconnected regular network in vitro and its localization into structures consistent with a cytoskeletal network in vivo. Furthermore, we reveal that a spatially restricted interaction between FilP and DivIVA, the main component of the Streptomyces polarisome complex, leads to formation of apical gradients of FilP in hyphae undergoing active tip extension. We propose that the coupling between the mechanism driving polar growth and the assembly of an IF cytoskeleton provides each new hypha with an additional stress-bearing structure at its tip, where the nascent cell wall is inevitably more flexible and compliant while it is being assembled and matured.

Children with MNA tumors were diagnosed at significantly younger ages than those with 11q- tumors (mean: 27.4 vs. 69.5 months; p=0.008; n=14/12), and MNA tumors had significantly fewer segmental chromosomal aberrations (mean: 5.5 vs. 12.0; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the 11q- tumor group a positive correlation was seen between the number of segmental aberrations and the age at diagnosis (Pearson Correlation 0.606; p=0.037). Among nonMNA/non11q- tumors (n=6), one tumor displayed amplicons on 11q and 12q and three others bore evidence of progression from low-risk tumors due to retrospective evidence of disease six years before diagnosis, or due to tumor profiles with high proportions of numerical chromosomal aberrations. An early age at diagnosis of MNA neuroblastomas was verified by registry data, with an average of 29.2 months for 43 cases that were not included in the present study.\n\nMNA and segmental 11q loss define two major genetic variants of unfavorable neuroblastoma with apparent differences in their pace of tumor evolution and in genomic integrity. Other possible, but less common, routes in the development of aggressive tumors are progression of low-risk infant-type lesions, and gene amplifications other than MYCN. Knowledge on such nosological diversity of aggressive neuroblastoma might influence future strategies for therapy.", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-13-231", "pmid": "23656755", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1471-2407-13-231"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3664071"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15185a5ef0034f8ea1dcde6ce36c2c01.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/15185a5ef0034f8ea1dcde6ce36c2c01"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "24c00563956b47dca65bbcdb397432bc", "title": "Active transcriptomic and proteomic reprogramming in the C. elegans nucleotide excision repair mutant xpa-1.", "authors": [{"family": "Arczewska", "given": "Katarzyna D", "initials": "KD"}, {"family": "Tomazella", "given": "Gisele G", "initials": "GG"}, {"family": "Lindvall", "given": "Jessica M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Kassahun", "given": "Henok", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Maglioni", "given": "Silvia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Torgovnick", "given": "Alessandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Henriksson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Matilainen", "given": "Olli", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Marquis", "given": "Bryce J", "initials": "BJ"}, {"family": "Nelson", "given": "Bryant C", "initials": "BC"}, {"family": "Jaruga", "given": "Pawel", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Babaie", "given": "Eshrat", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Holmberg", "given": "Carina I", "initials": "CI"}, {"family": "B\u00fcrglin", "given": "Thomas R", "initials": "TR"}, {"family": "Ventura", "given": "Natascia", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Thiede", "given": "Bernd", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Nilsen", "given": "Hilde", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "41", "issn": "1362-4962", "issue": "10", "pages": "5368-5381", "title": "Nucleic Acids Res."}, "abstract": "Transcription-blocking oxidative DNA damage is believed to contribute to aging and to underlie activation of oxidative stress responses and down-regulation of insulin-like signaling (ILS) in Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) deficient mice.

Both methods indicated activation of oxidative stress responses, which was substantiated biochemically by a bioenergetic shift involving increased steady-state reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. We identify the lesion-detection enzymes of Base Excision Repair (NTH-1) and global genome NER (XPC-1 and DDB-1) as upstream requirements for transcriptomic reprogramming as RNA-interference mediated depletion of these enzymes prevented up-regulation of genes over-expressed in the xpa-1 mutant.

As shown in human XPA cells, the levels of transcription-blocking 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine lesions were reduced in the xpa-1 mutant compared to the wild type. Hence, accumulation of cyclopurines is unlikely to be sufficient for reprogramming.

We prospectively studied the association of the genetic score with: (1) time-to-death; (2) incidence of the first of nine major diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, dementia, lung, breast, colon and prostate cancers) in two population-based cohorts of Dutch and Swedish individuals (N = 15,039; age range 47-99 years). During a median follow-up of 6.3 years (max 22.2 years), we observed 4,318 deaths and 2,132 incident disease events.

Phylogenet. Evol."}, "abstract": "Pyronemataceae is the largest and most heterogeneous family of Pezizomycetes. It is morphologically and ecologically highly diverse, comprising saprobic, ectomycorrhizal, bryosymbiotic and parasitic species, occurring in a broad range of habitats (on soil, burnt ground, debris, wood, dung and inside living bryophytes, plants and lichens). To assess the monophyly of Pyronemataceae and provide a phylogenetic hypothesis of the group, we compiled a four-gene dataset including one nuclear ribosomal and three protein-coding genes for 132 distinct Pezizomycetes species (4437 nucleotides with all markers available for 80% of the total 142 included taxa). This is the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Pyronemataceae, and Pezizomycetes, to date. Three hundred ninety-four new sequences were generated during this project, with the following numbers for each gene: RPB1 (124), RPB2 (99), EF-1\u03b1 (120) and LSU rDNA (51). The dataset includes 93 unique species from 40 genera of Pyronemataceae, and 34 species from 25 genera representing an additional 12 families of the class. Parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses suggest that Pyronemataceae is paraphyletic due to the nesting of both Ascodesmidaceae and Glaziellaceae within the family. Four lineages with taxa currently classified in the family, the Boubovia, Geopyxis, Pseudombrophila and Pulvinula lineages, form a monophyletic group with Ascodesmidaceae and Glaziellaceae. We advocate the exclusion of these four lineages in order to recognize a monophyletic Pyronemataceae. The genus Coprotus (Thelebolales, Leotiomycetes) is shown to belong to Pezizomycetes, forming a strongly supported monophyletic group with Boubovia. Ten strongly supported lineages are identified within Pyronemataceae s. str. Of these, the Pyropyxis and Otidea lineages are identified as successive sister lineages to the rest of Pyronemataceae s. str. The highly reduced (gymnohymenial) Monascella is shown to belong to Pezizomycetes and is for the first time suggested to be closely related to the cleistothecial Warcupia, as a sister group to the primarily apothecial Otidea. None of the lineages of pyronemataceous taxa identified here correspond to previous families or subfamily classifications. Ancestral character state reconstructions (ASR) using a Bayesian approach support that the ancestors of Pezizomycetes and Pyronemataceae were soil inhabiting and saprobic. Ectomycorrhizae have arisen within both lineages A, B and C of Pezizomycetes and are suggested to have evolved independently seven to eight times within Pyronemataceae s. l., whereas an obligate bryosymbiotic lifestyle has arisen only twice. No reversals to a free-living, saprobic lifestyle have happened from symbiotic or parasitic Pyronemataceae. Specializations to various substrates (e.g. burnt ground and dung) are suggested to have occurred several times in mainly saprobic lineages. Although carotenoids in the apothecia are shown to have arisen at least four times in Pezizomycetes, the ancestor of Pyronemataceae s. str., excluding the Pyropyxis and Otidea lineages, most likely produced carotenoids, which were then subsequently lost in some clades (- and possibly gained again). Excipular hairs were found with a high probability to be absent from apothecia in the deepest nodes of Pezizomycetes and in the ancestor of Pyronemataceae s. str. True hairs are restricted to the core group of Pyronemataceae s. str., but are also found in Lasiobolus (Ascodesmidaceae), the Pseudombrophila lineage and the clade of Chorioactidaceae, Sarcoscyphaceae and Sarcosomataceae. The number of gains and losses of true hairs within Pyronemataceae s. str., however, remains uncertain. The ASR of ascospore guttulation under binary coding (present or absent) indicates that this character is fast evolving and prone to shifts.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ympev.2013.01.014", "pmid": "23403226", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1055-7903(13)00051-1"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3ba82d89aad14984be5a0cbac09383b5.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/3ba82d89aad14984be5a0cbac09383b5"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "401ede1efc9b4c878a4b77f8ca000c4a", "title": "An adaptive alignment algorithm for quality-controlled label-free LC-MS.", "authors": [{"family": "Sandin", "given": "Marianne", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ali", "given": "Ashfaq", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hansson", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "M\u00e5nsson", "given": "Olle", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Andreasson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Resj\u00f6", "given": "Svante", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Levander", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}], "type": "comparative study", "published": "2013-05-00", "journal": {"volume": "12", "issn": "1535-9484", "issue": "5", "pages": "1407-1420", "title": "Mol.

We have identified candidate genes (rsb genes) from Mycobacterium marinum involved in the regulation of the activity of the alternative sigma factor, \u03c3(F) . This is a homolog of the master regulator of general stress response, \u03c3(B) , and the sporulation-specific sigma factor, \u03c3(F) , in Bacillus subtilis. The organization of these genes in M.\u00a0marinum and B.\u00a0subtilis is similar.

During the last decade it has become apparent that protein regions that do not fold into three-dimensional structures, i.e. intrinsically disordered regions, are quite common. Here, we have studied the relationship between protein disorder and indels using HMM-HMM pairwise alignments in two sets of orthologous eukaryotic protein pairs. First, we show that disordered residues are much more frequent among indel residues than among aligned residues and, also are more prevalent among indels than in coils. Second, we observed that disordered residues are particularly common in longer indels. Disordered indels of short-to-medium size are prevalent in the non-terminal regions of proteins while the longest indels, ordered and disordered alike, occur toward the termini of the proteins where new structural units are comparatively well tolerated. Finally, while disordered regions often evolve faster than ordered regions and disorder is common in indels, there are some previously recognized protein families where the disordered region is more conserved than the ordered region.

By characterizing cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) associated with genes regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), retinoids, or bone morphogenetic proteins in the CNS, we provide evidence that the neural-specific interpretation of morphogen signaling reflects a direct integration of these pathways with SoxB1 proteins at the CRM level. Moreover, expression of SoxB1 proteins in the limb bud confers on mesodermal cells the potential to activate neural-specific target genes upon Shh, retinoid, or bone morphogenetic protein signaling, and the collocation of binding sites for SoxB1 and morphogen-mediatory transcription factors in CRMs faithfully predicts neural-specific gene activity. Thus, an unexpectedly simple transcriptional paradigm appears to conceptually explain the neural-specific interpretation of pleiotropic signaling during vertebrate development. Importantly, genes induced in a SoxB1-dependent manner appear to constitute repressive gene regulatory networks that are directly interlinked at the CRM level to constrain the regional expression of patterning genes.

This shows that this comprehensive demonstration of the molecular changes underlying malignant transformation is a relevant model to study the process of tumor formation.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1216436110", "pmid": "23569271", "labels": {"Cell Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1216436110"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3637701"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/168f78a27d1e42f1ace305c0f5399d47.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/168f78a27d1e42f1ace305c0f5399d47"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c18933a273324f8f820b0d8cb51b36eb", "title": "Expression of fusion proteins of Aspergillus terreus reveals a novel allene oxide synthase.", "authors": [{"family": "Hoffmann", "given": "Inga", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Jerner\u00e9n", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Oliw", "given": "Ernst H", "initials": "EH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-04-19", "journal": {"volume": "288", "issn": "1083-351X", "issue": "16", "pages": "11459-11469", "title": "J.

Aspergillus terreus expresses linoleate 9R-dioxygenase (9R-DOX) and allene oxide synthase (AOS) activities in membrane fractions. The genome contains five genes (ATEG), which may code for a 9R-DOX-AOS fusion protein. The genes were cloned and expressed, but none of them oxidized 18:2n-6 to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE). ATEG_02036 transformed 9R-HPODE to an unstable allene oxide, 9(R),10-epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. A substitution in the P450 domain (C1073S) abolished AOS activity. The N964V and N964D mutants both showed markedly reduced AOS activity, suggesting that Asn(964) may facilitate homolytic cleavage of the dioxygen bond of 9R-HPODE with formation of compound II in analogy with plant AOS (CYP74) and prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A1). ATEG_03992 was identified as 5,8-linoleate diol synthase (5,8-LDS). Replacement of Asn(878) in 5,8-LDS with leucine (N878L) mainly shifted ferryl oxygen insertion from C-5 toward C-6, but replacements of Gln(881) markedly affected catalysis. The Q881L mutant virtually abolished the diol synthase activity. Replacement of Gln(881) with Asn, Glu, Asp, or Lys residues augmented the homolytic cleavage of 8R-HPODE with formation of 10-hydroxy-8(9)-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid (erythro/threo, 1-4:1) and/or shifted ferryl oxygen insertion from C-5 toward C-11. We conclude that homolysis and heterolysis of the dioxygen bond with formation of compound II in AOS and compound I in 5,8-LDS are influenced by Asn and Gln residues, respectively, of the I-helices.

Therefore, the long-term reduction in arterial pressure following renal denervation in drug-resistant hypertensive patients has been attributed to lack of afferent renal sensory reinnervation. However, afferent sensory reinnervation of any organ, including the kidney, is an understudied question. Therefore, we analyzed the time course of sympathetic and sensory reinnervation at multiple time points (1, 4, and 5 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 wk) after renal denervation in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Sympathetic and sensory innervation in the innervated and contralateral denervated kidney was determined as optical density (ImageJ) of the sympathetic and sensory nerves identified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against markers for sympathetic nerves [neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)] and sensory nerves [substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)]. In denervated kidneys, the optical density of NPY-immunoreactive (ir) fibers in the renal cortex and substance P-ir fibers in the pelvic wall was 6, 39, and 100% and 8, 47, and 100%, respectively, of that in the contralateral innervated kidney at 4 days, 4 wk, and 12 wk after denervation. Linear regression analysis of the optical density of the ratio of the denervated/innervated kidney versus time yielded similar intercept and slope values for NPY-ir, TH-ir, substance P-ir, and CGRP-ir fibers (all R(2) > 0.76).

To establish the prevalence of restrictive eating problems, the overlap and association with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to estimate the heritability of eating problems in a general population sample of twins aged 9 and 12. METHODS. Parents of all Swedish 9- and 12-year-old twin pairs born between 1993 and 1998 (n = 12,366) were interviewed regarding symptoms of ADHD, ASD, and eating problems (EAT-P). Intraclass correlations and structural equation modelling were used for evaluating the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Cross-twin, cross-trait correlations were used to indicate a possible overlap between conditions. RESULTS. The prevalence of eating problems was 0.6% in the study population and was significantly higher in children with ADHD and/or ASD. Among children with eating problems, 40% were screened positive for ADHD and/or ASD. Social interaction problems were strongly associated with EAT-P in girls, and impulsivity and activity problems with EAT-P in boys. The cross-twin, cross-trait correlations suggested low correlations between EAT-P and ADHD or EAT-P and ASD. Genetic effects accounted for 44% of the variation in liability for eating problems.

We report results from the first large-scale collaboration that studies the molecular genetic architecture of an economic variable-entrepreneurship-that was operationalized using self-employment, a widely-available proxy. Our results suggest that common SNPs when considered jointly explain about half of the narrow-sense heritability of self-employment estimated in twin data (\u03c3(g)(2)/\u03c3(P)(2)\u200a=\u200a25%, h(2)\u200a=\u200a55%).

Furthermore, a gene-based test shows that none of the genes that were previously suggested in the literature to influence entrepreneurship reveal significant associations. Finally, SNP-based genetic scores that use results from the meta-analysis capture less than 0.2% of the variance in self-employment in an independent sample (p\u22650.039).

The aim of this study was to use a systematic approach to generate and screen affinity-purified, mono-specific antibodies targeting progression-related biomarkers, with a view towards developing a clinically applicable IHC-based prognostic biomarker panel for breast cancer.\n\nWe examined both in-house and publicly available breast cancer DNA microarray datasets relating to invasion and metastasis, thus identifying a cohort of candidate progression-associated biomarkers. Of these, 18 antibodies were released for extended analysis. Validated antibodies were screened against a tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from a cohort of consecutive breast cancer cases (n\u2009=\u2009512) to test the immunohistochemical surrogate signature.\n\nAntibody screening revealed 3 candidate prognostic markers: the cell cycle regulator, Anillin (ANLN); the mitogen-activated protein kinase, PDZ-Binding Kinase (PBK); and the estrogen response gene, PDZ-Domain Containing 1 (PDZK1). Increased expression of ANLN and PBK was associated with poor prognosis, whilst increased expression of PDZK1 was associated with good prognosis. A 3-marker signature comprised of high PBK, high ANLN and low PDZK1 expression was associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This novel signature was associated with high tumour grade (p\u2009<\u20090.001), positive nodal status (p\u2009=\u20090.029), ER-negativity (p\u2009=\u20090.006), Her2-positivity (p\u2009=\u20090.036) and high Ki67 status (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that the signature was not a significant predictor of BCSS (HR\u2009=\u20096.38; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.79-51.26, p\u2009=\u20090.082).\n\nWe have developed a comprehensive biomarker pathway that extends from discovery through to validation on a TMA platform.

To investigate the impact of RORA on asthma susceptibility, we performed a genetic association study between RORA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the asthma-associated SNP (rs11071559) and asthma-related traits. Because the regulatory region of a previously implicated asthma susceptibility gene, Neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1), has predicted elements for RORA binding, we hypothesized that RORA may interact biologically and genetically with NPSR1. 37 RORA SNPs and eight NPSR1 SNPs were genotyped in the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (2033 children) and the European cross-sectional PARSIFAL study (1120 children). Seven RORA SNPs confined into a 49 kb region were significantly associated with physician-diagnosed childhood asthma. The most significant association with rs7164773 (T/C) was driven by the CC genotype in asthma cases (OR\u200a=\u200a2.0, 95%CI 1.36-2.93, p\u200a=\u200a0.0003 in BAMSE; and 1.61, 1.18-2.19, p\u200a=\u200a0.002 in the combined BAMSE-PARSIFAL datasets, respectively), and strikingly, the risk effect was dependent on the Gln344Arg mutation in NPSR1. In cell models, stimulation of NPSR1 activated a pathway including RORA and other circadian clock genes. Over-expression of RORA decreased NPSR1 promoter activity further suggesting a regulatory loop between these genes. In addition, Rora mRNA expression was lower in the lung tissue of Npsr1 deficient mice compared to wildtype littermates during the early hours of the light period. We conclude that RORA SNPs are associated with childhood asthma and show epistasis with NPSR1, and the interaction between RORA and NPSR1 may be of biological relevance.

Thymosin beta 4 (T\u03b24) has been associated with biological activities in tissue repair and cell migration via interaction with ATP-synthase in vertebrates, while the information of similar thymosin functions in invertebrates is limited. We have shown previously that ATP-synthase is present on the surface of crayfish hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells, and that astakine 1 (Ast1, an invertebrate cytokine) was found to interact with this \u03b2-subunit of ATP synthase. Here, we identified five different \u03b2-thymosins from Pacifastacus leniusculus, designated Pl-\u03b2-thymosin1-5. The two dominant isoforms in brain, HPT and hemocytes, Pl-\u03b2-thymosin1 and 2, were chosen for functional studies. Both isoforms could bind to the \u03b2-subunit of ATP-synthase, and Pl-\u03b2-thymosin1, but not Pl-\u03b2-thymosin2, significantly increased extracellular ATP formation. Moreover, Pl-\u03b2-thymosin1 stimulated HPT cell migration in vitro and Ast1 blocked this effect. Pl-\u03b2-thymosin2 increased the circulating hemocyte number at an early stage after injection. Additionally, in vivo injection of Pl-\u03b2-thymosin1 resulted in significant reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in crayfish HPT whereas Pl-\u03b2-thymosin2 had a similar but transient effect. Both Pl-\u03b2-thymosins induced the expression of Ast1 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) transcripts, while silencing of endogenous Pl-\u03b2-thymosin 1 and 2 by RNAi resulted in significant reduction of the Ast1 and SOD transcripts.

Functional studies of the mouse orthologue Qk focused mainly on its role in oligodendrocyte development and myelination, while its function in astroglia remained unexplored. Here, we show that QKI is highly expressed in human primary astrocytes and that its splice forms encode proteins targeting different subcellular localizations. Uncovering the role of QKI in astrocytes is of interest in light of growing evidence implicating astrocyte dysfunction in the pathogenesis of several disorders of the central nervous system. We selectively silenced QKI splice variants in human primary astrocytes and used RNA sequencing to identify differential expression and splice variant composition at the genome-wide level. We found that an mRNA expression of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), encoding a major component of astrocyte intermediate filaments, was down-regulated after QKI7 splice variant silencing. Moreover, we identified a potential QKI-binding site within the 3' untranslated region of human GFAP. This sequence was not conserved between mice and humans, raising the possibility that GFAP is a target for QKI in humans but not rodents. Haloperidol treatment of primary astrocytes resulted in coordinated increases in QKI7 and GFAP expression. Taken together, our results provide the first link between QKI and GFAP, two genes with alterations previously observed independently in schizophrenic patients.

ABCB7 up and downregulation did not influence growth and survival of K562 cells. In normal bone marrow, ABCB7 downregulation reduced erythroid differentiation, growth and colony formation, and resulted in a gene expression pattern similar to that observed in intermediate RARS erythroblasts, and in the accumulation of FTMT. Importantly, forced ABCB7 expression restored erythroid colony growth and decreased FTMT expression level in RARS CD34+ marrow cells.

However, whether divergent strains of highly recombining intracellular bacteria, such as Wolbachia, can maintain their genetic distinctness when infecting the same host is not known. We first developed a protocol for the genome sequencing of uncultivable endosymbionts. Using this method, we have sequenced the complete genomes of the Wolbachia strains wHa and wNo, which occur as natural double infections in Drosophila simulans populations on the Seychelles and in New Caledonia. Taxonomically, wHa belong to supergroup A and wNo to supergroup B. A comparative genomics study including additional strains supported the supergroup classification scheme and revealed 24 and 33 group-specific genes, putatively involved in host-adaptation processes. Recombination frequencies were high for strains of the same supergroup despite different host-preference patterns, leading to genomic cohesion. The inferred recombination fragments for strains of different supergroups were of short sizes, and the genomes of the co-infecting Wolbachia strains wHa and wNo were not more similar to each other and did not share more genes than other A- and B-group strains that infect different hosts. We conclude that Wolbachia strains of supergroup A and B represent genetically distinct clades, and that strains of different supergroups can co-exist in the same arthropod host without converging into the same species. This suggests that the supergroups are irreversibly separated and that barriers other than host-specialization are able to maintain distinct clades in recombining endosymbiont populations.

We performed RNA sequencing of several tissues from male and female ostriches and assembled the transcriptome de novo.

In a homogeneous landscape with limited dispersal, the similarity in abundance of taxa in samples declines with separation distance. We present a one-dimensional model for the spatial autocorrelation in abundances arising from immigration from some remote community and dispersal between environmentally similar landscape patches. Spatial correlation in taxa abundances were calculated from biofilms from the beds of two flumes which differed only in their bedform profiles; one flat and the other a periodic sawtooth shape. The hydraulic regime is approximately uniform over the flat bed, whereas the sawtooth induces fast flow over the peaks and recirculation in the troughs. On the flat bed, the correlation decline between samples was reproduced by a model using one biologically reasonable parameter. A decline was apparent in the other flume; however, a better fit was achieved when dispersal was not assumed constant everywhere. However, analysis of finer-resolution data for the heterogeneous flume suggested even this model did not adequately capture the community's complexity.

When generating antibodies for protein profiling of the human proteome, an important step in the quality control is to compare staining patterns of different antibodies directed towards the same protein. This comparison is an ultimate control that the antibody recognizes the right protein. In this paper, we propose and evaluate different approaches for classifying sub-cellular antibody staining patterns in breast tissue samples.\n\nThe proposed methods include the computation of various features including gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, complex wavelet co-occurrence matrix (CWCM) features, and weighted neighbor distance using compound hierarchy of algorithms representing morphology (WND-CHARM)-inspired features. The extracted features are used into two different multivariate classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier). Before extracting features, we use color deconvolution to separate different tissue components, such as the brownly stained positive regions and the blue cellular regions, in the immuno-stained TMA images of breast tissue.\n\nWe present classification results based on combinations of feature measurements. The proposed complex wavelet features and the WND-CHARM features have accuracy similar to that of a human expert.\n\nBoth human experts and the proposed automated methods have difficulties discriminating between nuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns. This is to a large extent due to mixed staining of nucleus and cytoplasm. Methods for quantification of staining patterns in histopathology have many applications, ranging from antibody quality control to tumor grading.", "doi": "10.4103/2153-3539.109881", "pmid": "23766936", "labels": {"Tissue Profiling": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "JPI-4-14"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3678740"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/11fa4908f11749e2a8ed03dbef5a8055.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/11fa4908f11749e2a8ed03dbef5a8055"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "56fddc630d6e4ef59e07267939994a3f", "title": "Genetic variants from lipid-related pathways and risk for incident myocardial infarction.", "authors": [{"family": "Song", "given": "Ci", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Pedersen", "given": "Nancy L", "initials": "NL"}, {"family": "Reynolds", "given": "Chandra A", "initials": "CA"}, {"family": "Sabater-Lleal", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kanoni", "given": "Stavroula", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Willenborg", "given": "Christina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium", "given": "None", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Syv\u00e4nen", "given": "Ann-Christine", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Watkins", "given": "Hugh", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Hamsten", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Prince", "given": "Jonathan A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Ingelsson", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-03-29", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "3", "pages": "e60454", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Circulating lipids levels, as well as several familial lipid metabolism disorders, are strongly associated with initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of myocardial infarction (MI).\r\n\r\nWe hypothesized that genetic variants associated with circulating lipid levels would also be associated with MI incidence, and have tested this in three independent samples.\r\n\r\nUsing age- and sex-adjusted additive genetic models, we analyzed 554 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 41 candidate gene regions proposed to be involved in lipid-related pathways potentially predisposing to incidence of MI in 2,602 participants of the Swedish Twin Register (STR; 57% women).

Assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes is intimately linked to DNA topology, and DNA topoisomerases have previously been implicated in the dynamics of canonical H3 nucleosomes. Here we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Top3 and its partner Rqh1 are involved in controlling the levels of CENP-A(Cnp1) at centromeres. Both top3 and rqh1 mutants display defects in chromosome segregation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and tiling microarrays, we show that Top3, unlike Top1 and Top2, is highly enriched at centromeric central domains, demonstrating that Top3 is the major topoisomerase in this region. Moreover, centromeric Top3 occupancy positively correlates with CENP-A(Cnp1) occupancy. Intriguingly, both top3 and rqh1 mutants display increased relative enrichment of CENP-A(Cnp1) at centromeric central domains.

We investigated the effects of five polymorphisms on cognitive functioning in a population-based sample of 2,694 persons without dementia (60-102 years). A structural equation model (SEM) was fit to the cognitive data, yielding five specific latent factors (perceptual speed, episodic memory, semantic memory, category fluency, and letter fluency), as well as a global cognitive factor. These factors showed the expected associations with chronological age. Genotyping was performed for five single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with cognitive performance: APOE (rs429358), COMT (rs4680), BDNF (rs6265), KIBRA (rs17070145), and CLSTN2 (rs6439886). After controlling for age, gender, and education, as well as correcting for multiple comparisons, we observed negative effects of being an APOE \u03b54 carrier on episodic memory and perceptual speed. Furthermore, being a CLSTN2 TT carrier was associated with poorer semantic memory. For the global factor, the same pattern of results was observed.

The structure of the AB-domain fragment, which was solved by molecular replacement to 1.45\u2005\u00c5 resolution, reveals that despite a lack of overall sequence identity the A domain is structurally very similar to the B domain. Combining the structures of the two fragments provides a view of the complete three-domain extramembrane part of LdtMt2 and shows that the protein extends at least 80-100\u2005\u00c5 from the plasma membrane into the peptidoglycan layer and thus defines the maximal distance at which cross-links are formed by this enzyme.

Here, we present a comparative analysis of 16 Bartonella genomes ranging from 1.4 to 2.6 Mb in size, including six novel genomes from Bartonella isolated from a cow, two moose, two dogs, and a kangaroo. A phylogenetic tree inferred from 428 orthologous core genes indicates that the deadly human pathogen B. bacilliformis is related to the ruminant-adapted clade, rather than being the earliest diverging species in the genus as previously thought. A gene flux analysis identified 12 genes for a GTA and a phage-derived origin of replication as the most conserved innovations. These are located in a region of a few hundred kb that also contains 8 insertions of gene clusters for type III, IV, and V secretion systems, and genes for putatively secreted molecules such as cholera-like toxins. The phylogenies indicate a recent transfer of seven genes in the virB gene cluster for a type IV secretion system from a cat-adapted B. henselae to a dog-adapted B. vinsonii strain. We show that the B. henselae GTA is functional and can transfer genes in vitro. We suggest that the maintenance of the GTA is driven by selection to increase the likelihood of horizontal gene transfer and argue that this process is beneficial at the population level, by facilitating adaptive evolution of the host-adaptation systems and thereby expansion of the host range size.

This ability to respond to environmental daily rhythms has been conserved along evolution, and it is found among species from bacteria to mammals. The hematopoietic process of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is under circadian control and is tightly regulated by astakines, a new family of cytokines sharing a prokineticin (PROK) domain. The expression of AST1 and AST2 are light-dependent, and this suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for PROK domain proteins in mediating circadian rhythms. Vertebrate PROKs are transmitters of circadian rhythms of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain of mammals, but the mechanism by which they function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that high AST2 expression is induced by melatonin in the brain. We identify RACK1 as a binding protein of AST2 and further provide evidence that a complex between AST2 and RACK1 functions as a negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock. By DNA mobility shift assay, we showed that the AST2-RACK1 complex will interfere with the binding between BMAL1 and CLK and inhibit the E-box binding activity of the complex BMAL1-CLK. Finally, we demonstrate by gene knockdown that AST2 is necessary for melatonin-induced inhibition of the complex formation between BMAL1 and CLK during the dark period. In summary, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates AST2 expression and thereby affects the core clock of the crustacean brain. This process may be very important in all animals that have AST2 molecules, i.e. spiders, ticks, crustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Blattodea, but not Diptera and Coleoptera.

In the hypothalamus, 32 transcripts were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) when tail biters were compared with neutral pigs, 130 when comparing receiver pigs with neutrals, and two when tail biters were compared with receivers. In the prefrontal cortex, seven transcripts were differently expressed in tail biters when compared with neutrals, seven in receivers vs. neutrals and none in the tail biters vs. receivers. In total, 19 genes showed a different expression pattern in neutral pigs when compared with both performers and receivers.

By employing an unbiased metagenomic approach, which allows the detection of both unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, the detection of three viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), in honeybees from Spain is reported in this article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees was only recently reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in Europe. Similarly, LSV appear to be a still unclassified group of viruses with unclear impact on colony health and these viruses have not previously been identified outside of the United States. Furthermore, our study also reveals that these bees carried a plant virus, Turnip Ringspot Virus (TuRSV), potentially serving as important vector organisms.

This pattern is compatible with an early appearance at the time of the emergence of prokaryotic cellular life. The medium-chain form (MDR) is also old but second in terms of all the parameters above, and therefore compatible with a second emergence. However, this step appears seemingly earlier than previously considered, and may indicate sub-stages of early emergences at the increased resolution available from the now greater number of data entries. The Zn-MDR origin constitutes a third stage, possibly compatible with the transition to oxidative conditions on earth. Within all these three lines, repeated enzymogeneses gave the present divergence. MDR-ADH origin(s), at a fourth stage, may also be further resolved in multiple or extended modes, but the classical liver MDR-ADH of the liver type can still be traced to a gene duplication ~550 MYA (million years ago), at the early vertebrate radiation, compatible with the post-eon-shift, \"Cambrian explosion\". Classes and isozymes correspond to subsequent and recent duplicatory events, respectively. They illustrate a peculiar pattern with functional and emerging evolutionary distinctions between parent and emerging lines, suggesting a parallelism between duplicatory and mutational events, now also visible at separate sub-stages.

We found that sperm with longer midpieces have higher levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but that greater energy reserves do not translate into faster-swimming sperm. Additionally, we found that interspecific variation in sperm ATP concentration is not associated with the level of sperm competition faced by males. Finally, using Bayesian methods, we compared the evolutionary trajectories of sperm morphology and ATP content, and show that both traits have undergone directional evolutionary change. However, in contrast to recent suggestions in other taxa, we show that changes in ATP are unlikely to have preceded changes in morphology in passerine sperm.

During non-perturbed conditions, sampling sites clustered into three groups based on their microbial community composition: an offshore oceanic group, a freshwater group, and a distinct and persistent coastal group. Significant differences in measured environmental parameters or in the bacterial community due to the storm event were found only within the coastal cluster of sampling sites, and only at 5 of 12 locations; three of these sites showed a significant response in both environmental and bacterial community characteristics. These responses were most pronounced at sites close to the shoreline. During the storm event, otherwise common bacterioplankton community members such as marine Synechococcus sp. and members of the SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria decreased in relative abundance in the affected coastal zone, whereas several lineages of Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and members of the Roseobacter clade of Alphaproteobacteria increased. The complex spatial patterns in both environmental conditions and microbial community structure related to freshwater runoff and wind convection during the perturbation event leads us to conclude that spatial heterogeneity was an important factor influencing both the dynamics and the resistance of the bacterioplankton communities to disturbances throughout this complex subtropical coastal system.

We explored the causality and direction of the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] using genetic markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.\n\nWe used information from 21 adult cohorts (up to 42,024 participants) with 12 BMI-related SNPs (combined in an allelic score) to produce an instrument for BMI and four SNPs associated with 25(OH)D (combined in two allelic scores, separately for genes encoding its synthesis or metabolism) as an instrument for vitamin D. Regression estimates for the IVs (allele scores) were generated within-study and pooled by meta-analysis to generate summary effects. Associations between vitamin D scores and BMI were confirmed in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium (n\u200a=\u200a123,864). Each 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with 1.15% lower 25(OH)D (p\u200a=\u200a6.52\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2077). The BMI allele score was associated both with BMI (p\u200a=\u200a6.30\u00d710\u207b\u2076\u00b2) and 25(OH)D (-0.06% [95% CI -0.10 to -0.02], p\u200a=\u200a0.004) in the cohorts that underwent meta-analysis. The two vitamin D allele scores were strongly associated with 25(OH)D (p\u22648.07\u00d710\u207b\u2075\u2077 for both scores) but not with BMI (synthesis score, p\u200a=\u200a0.88; metabolism score, p\u200a=\u200a0.08) in the meta-analysis. A 10% higher genetically instrumented BMI was associated with 4.2% lower 25(OH)D concentrations (IV ratio: -4.2 [95% CI -7.1 to -1.3], p\u200a=\u200a0.005). No association was seen for genetically instrumented 25(OH)D with BMI, a finding that was confirmed using data from the GIANT consortium (p\u22650.57 for both vitamin D scores).\n\nOn the basis of a bi-directional genetic approach that limits confounding, our study suggests that a higher BMI leads to lower 25(OH)D, while any effects of lower 25(OH)D increasing BMI are likely to be small.

One-fourth of the segregating acrocona plants initiate cones already in their second growth cycle, suggesting control by a single locus. The early cone-setting properties of the acrocona mutant were utilized to identify candidate genes involved in vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in Norway spruce. Poly(A(+)) RNA samples from apical and basal shoots of cone-setting and non-cone-setting plants were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq). We assembled and investigated 33,383 expressed putative protein-coding acrocona transcripts. Eight transcripts were differentially expressed between selected sample pairs. One of these (Acr42124_1) was significantly up-regulated in apical shoot samples from cone-setting acrocona plants, and the encoded protein belongs to the MADS box gene family of transcription factors.

Although no true complement homologues have been detected in crayfish or crustaceans, several proteins with similarities to vertebrate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are involved in the lectin pathway of complement activation in vertebrates, are present. One is a C-type lectin, a mannose-binding lectin (Pl-MBL), which is secreted from granular hemocytes. Here we report that Pl-MBL has LPS-binding capacity and is dependent upon high Ca(2+) for its solubility and Pl-MBL interferes with proPO activation in vitro when HLS is prepared at high Ca(2+). The proPO-activating system is efficiently activated by microbial polysaccharides and it has to be neatly regulated to avoid activation in places where it is inappropriate and the active enzyme PO should be prevented from spreading throughout the body of the animal. This may be particularly important during molting when proPO is involved in hardening of a new cuticle and the animal is vulnerable to microbes. The presence of high amount of Pl-MBL in the granular hemocytes may play a role in this process. Since a hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) prepared at 100 mM Ca(2+) could become activated when the concentration of LPS was increased up to 3 mg/ml, this may indicate that Pl-MBL acts as a scavenger for LPS to prevent spreading of LPS in the hemolymph to avoid further activation of the proPO-system.", "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2012.02.011", "pmid": "22459272", "labels": {"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)": null, "NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0171-2985(12)00056-3"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/598fbcca822f435b8d94bbd4034c2660.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/598fbcca822f435b8d94bbd4034c2660"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "752ae511ee974720af3eb8a3ba277f87", "title": "Adipose tissue resting energy expenditure and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function are higher in women than in men.", "authors": [{"family": "Nookaew", "given": "Intawat", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Svensson", "given": "Per-Arne", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Jacobson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Jern\u00e5s", "given": "Margareta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Taube", "given": "Magdalena", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Andersson-Assarsson", "given": "Johanna C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Froguel", "given": "Philippe", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Walley", "given": "Andrew", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Carlsson", "given": "Lena M S", "initials": "LM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-02-00", "journal": {"volume": "98", "issn": "1945-7197", "issue": "2", "pages": "E370-E378", "title": "J.

The genetic determinants of this process are poorly characterized.\n\nGenetic association analyses of inter-adventitial common carotid artery diameter (ICCAD) in the IMPROVE study (n\u00a0=\u00a03427) using the Illumina 200k Metabochip was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met array-wide significance were taken forward for analysis in three further studies (n\u00a0=\u00a05704), and tested for association with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).\n\nrs3768445 on Chromosome 1q24.3, in a cluster of protein coding genes (DNM3, PIGC, C1orf105) was associated with larger ICCAD in the IMPROVE study. For each copy of the rare allele carried, ICCAD was on average 0.13\u00a0mm greater (95% CI 0.08-0.18\u00a0mm, P\u00a0=\u00a08.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)). A proxy SNP (rs4916251, R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.99) did not, however, show association with ICCAD in three follow-up studies (P for replication\u00a0=\u00a00.29). There was evidence of interaction between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and rs4916251 on ICCAD in two of the cohorts studies suggesting that it plays a role in the remodelling response to atherosclerosis. In meta-analysis of 5 case-control studies pooling data from 5007 cases and 43,630 controls, rs4916251 was associated with presence of AAA 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17, p\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-3), I(2)\u00a0=\u00a018.8, Q\u00a0=\u00a00.30). A proxy SNP, rs4916251 was also associated with increased expression of PIGC in aortic tissue, suggesting that this may the mechanism by which this locus affects vascular remodelling.\n\nCommon variation at 1q24.3 is associated with expansive vascular remodelling and risk of AAA.

By combining data from >140,000 individuals of European ancestry within the Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC), we identified and replicated 28 genome-wide significant loci in association with serum urate concentrations (18 new regions in or near TRIM46, INHBB, SFMBT1, TMEM171, VEGFA, BAZ1B, PRKAG2, STC1, HNF4G, A1CF, ATXN2, UBE2Q2, IGF1R, NFAT5, MAF, HLF, ACVR1B-ACVRL1 and B3GNT4). Associations for many of the loci were of similar magnitude in individuals of non-European ancestry.

DNA-mediated affinity-based assays, such as immuno-PCR and proximity ligation assays (PLA), use oligonucleotides attached to affinity reagents as reporter molecules. Conjugation of oligonucleotides to affinity reagents generally employs chemistries that target primary amines or cysteines. Because of the random nature of these processes neither the number of oligonucleotides conjugated per molecule nor their sites of attachment can be accurately controlled for affinity reagents with several available amines and cysteines. Here, we present a straightforward and convenient approach to functionalize recombinant affinity reagents for PLA by expressing the reagents as fusion partners with SNAP protein tags. This allowed us to conjugate oligonucleotides in a site-specific fashion, yielding precisely one oligonucleotide per affinity reagent. We demonstrate this method using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) recognizing the tumor antigen HER2 and we apply the conjugates in different assay formats. We also show that SNAP or CLIP tags, expressed as fusion partners of transfected genes, allow oligonucleotide conjugations to be performed in fixed cells, with no need for specific affinity reagents. The approach is used to demonstrate induced interactions between the fusion proteins FKBP and FRB by allowing the in situ conjugated oligonucleotides to direct the production of templates for localized rolling circle amplification reactions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nbt.2012.05.005", "pmid": "22664266", "labels": {"PLA Proteomics": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1871-6784(12)00107-0"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9c786f1bc8bb4c8c8d8de227ac395e4f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/9c786f1bc8bb4c8c8d8de227ac395e4f"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "dd2df100118046b5bd0e391d60c77107", "title": "Multiplex protein detection with DNA readout via mass spectrometry.", "authors": [{"family": "Flanigon", "given": "James", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kamali-Moghaddam", "given": "Masood", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Burbulis", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Annink", "given": "Carla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Steffen", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Oeth", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Brent", "given": "Roger", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "van den Boom", "given": "Dirk", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Cantor", "given": "Charles", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-01-25", "journal": {"volume": "30", "issn": "1876-4347", "issue": "2", "pages": "153-158", "title": "N Biotechnol"}, "abstract": "Multiplex protein quantification has been constrained by issues of assay specificity, sensitivity and throughput.

Neuropeptide S Receptor 1 (NPSR1) has been associated with asthma and allergy and a study suggested modulation of the genetic risk by environmental factors. We aimed to study DNA methylation in the promoter region of NPSR1 in relation to asthma and environmental exposures. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was used to investigate potential functional roles of both genotypes and methylation status in the NPSR1 promoter. DNA methylation was analysed using EpiTYPER in blood samples from two well-characterized cohorts; the BIOAIR study of severe asthma in adults and the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE. We observed that DNA methylation and genetic variants in the promoter influenced the binding of nuclear proteins to DNA, suggesting functional relevance. Significant, although small, differences in methylation were related to both adult severe asthma (p\u200a=\u200a0.0001) and childhood allergic asthma (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). Furthermore, DNA methylation was associated with exposures such as current smoking in adults for two CpG sites (p\u200a=\u200a0.005 and 0.04), parental smoking during infancy in the children (p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and in which month the sample was taken (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). In summary, DNA methylation levels in the promoter of NPSR1 showed small but significant associations with asthma, both in adults and in children, and to related traits such as allergy and certain environmental exposures. Both genetic variation and the methylated state of CpG sites seem to have an effect on the binding of nuclear proteins in the regulatory region of NPSR1 suggesting complex regulation of this gene in asthma and allergy.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0053877", "pmid": "23372674", "labels": {"Mutation Analysis Facility (MAF)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-12-14529"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3553086"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c241a08918ae412aa88963b509d13d63.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/c241a08918ae412aa88963b509d13d63"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "39fee09c147549d49b073f4fa59ac00b", "title": "Unveiling distribution patterns of freshwater phytoplankton by a next generation sequencing based approach.", "authors": [{"family": "Eiler", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Drakare", "given": "Stina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bertilsson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pernthaler", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Peura", "given": "Sari", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rofner", "given": "Carina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Simek", "given": "Karel", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Yang", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Znachor", "given": "Petr", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Lindstr\u00f6m", "given": "Eva S", "initials": "ES"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-01-22", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "1", "pages": "e53516", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "The recognition and discrimination of phytoplankton species is one of the foundations of freshwater biodiversity research and environmental monitoring.

Direct comparison of NGS to microscopic data from three time-series showed that NGS was able to capture the seasonality in phytoplankton succession as observed by microscopy. Still, the PCR-based approach was only semi-quantitative, and detailed NGS and microscopy taxa lists had only low taxonomic correspondence. This is probably due to, both, methodological constraints and current discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks. Discrepancies included Euglenophyta and Heterokonta that were scarce in the NGS but frequently detected by microscopy and Cyanobacteria that were in general more abundant and classified with high resolution by NGS. A deep-branching taxonomically unclassified cluster was frequently detected by NGS but could not be linked to any group identified by microscopy. NGS derived phytoplankton composition differed significantly among lakes with different trophic status, showing that our approach can resolve phytoplankton communities at a level relevant for ecosystem management.

Here we describe the 7.67-Mbp genome of Malassezia sympodialis, a species associated with atopic eczema, and contrast its genome repertoire with that of Malassezia globosa, associated with dandruff, as well as those of other closely related fungi. Ninety percent of the predicted M. sympodialis protein coding genes were experimentally verified by mass spectrometry at the protein level. We identified a relatively limited number of genes related to lipid biosynthesis, and both species lack the fatty acid synthase gene, in line with the known requirement of these yeasts to assimilate lipids from the host. Malassezia species do not appear to have many cell wall-localized glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) proteins and lack other cell wall proteins previously identified in other fungi. This is surprising given that in other fungi these proteins have been shown to mediate interactions (e.g., adhesion and biofilm formation) with the host. The genome revealed a complex evolutionary history for an allergen of unknown function, Mala s 7, shown to be encoded by a member of an amplified gene family of secreted proteins. Based on genetic and biochemical studies with the basidiomycete human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, we characterized the allergen Mala s 6 as the cytoplasmic cyclophilin A. We further present evidence that M. sympodialis may have the capacity to undergo sexual reproduction and present a model for a pseudobipolar mating system that allows limited recombination between two linked MAT loci.\n\nMalassezia commensal yeasts are associated with a number of skin disorders. The previously published genome of M. globosa provided some of the first insights into Malassezia biology and its involvement in dandruff. Here, we present the genome of M. sympodialis, frequently isolated from patients with atopic eczema and healthy individuals. We combined comparative genomics with sequencing and functional characterization of specific genes in a population of clinical isolates and in closely related model systems. Our analyses provide insights into the evolution of allergens related to atopic eczema and the evolutionary trajectory of the machinery for sexual reproduction and meiosis. We hypothesize that M. sympodialis may undergo sexual reproduction, which has important implications for the understanding of the life cycle and virulence potential of this medically important yeast.

However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs.\n\nHere we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform.\n\nBMIQ is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/bmiq/.\n\na.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk\n\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bts680", "pmid": "23175756", "labels": {"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bts680"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3546795"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8612a29d126645759788621e019e0ea4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/8612a29d126645759788621e019e0ea4"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "baa73d4e57d84fffa56934c8956bf61b", "title": "Gene expression deregulation in postnatal skeletal muscle of TK2 deficient mice reveals a lower pool of proliferating myogenic progenitor cells.", "authors": [{"family": "Paredes", "given": "Jo\u00e3o A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Zhou", "given": "Xiaoshan", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "H\u00f6glund", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-01-14", "journal": {"volume": "8", "issn": "1932-6203", "issue": "1", "pages": "e53698", "title": "PLoS ONE"}, "abstract": "Loss of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) causes a heterogeneous myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) in humans that predominantly affects skeletal muscle tissue.

We analysed skeletal muscle and heart muscle tissues of Tk2 knockout mice at postnatal development phase and observed that TK2 deficient pups grew slower and their skeletal muscles appeared significantly underdeveloped, whereas heart was close to normal in size. Both tissues showed mtDNA depletion and mitochondria with altered ultrastructure, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression microarray analysis showed a strong down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell proliferation in both tissues, suggesting a lower pool of undifferentiated proliferating cells. Analysis of isolated primary myoblasts from Tk2 knockout mice showed slow proliferation, less ability to differentiate and signs of premature senescence, even in absence of mtDNA depletion.

So far, the value of these multigene signatures in clinical practice is unclear, and the biologic importance of individual genes is difficult to assess, as the published signatures virtually do not overlap.\n\nHere, we describe a novel single institute cohort, including 196 non-small lung cancers (NSCLC) with clinical information and long-term follow-up. Gene expression array data were used as a training set to screen for single genes with prognostic impact. The top 450 probe sets identified using a univariate Cox regression model (significance level P < 0.01) were tested in a meta-analysis including five publicly available independent lung cancer cohorts (n = 860).\n\nThe meta-analysis revealed 14 genes that were significantly associated with survival (P < 0.001) with a false discovery rate <1%. The prognostic impact of one of these genes, the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 2 independent NSCLC cohorts, altogether including 617 NSCLC samples. Low CADM1 protein expression was significantly associated with shorter survival, with particular influence in the adenocarcinoma patient subgroup.\n\nUsing a novel NSCLC cohort together with a meta-analysis validation approach, we have identified a set of single genes with independent prognostic impact. One of these genes, CADM1, was further established as an immunohistochemical marker with a potential application in clinical diagnostics.", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1139", "pmid": "23032747",

On an unprecedented scale, we revealed 2239 differentially methylated CpG sites between IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients, with the majority of sites positioned outside annotated CpG islands. Intriguingly, CLL prognostic genes (for example, CLLU1, LPL, ZAP70 and NOTCH1), epigenetic regulator (for example, HDAC9, HDAC4 and DNMT3B), B-cell signaling (for example, IBTK) and numerous TGF-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB/TNF pathway genes were alternatively methylated between subgroups. Contrary, DNA methylation over time was deemed rather stable with few recurrent changes noted within subgroups. Although a larger number of non-recurrent changes were identified among IGHV-unmutated relative to mutated cases over time, these equated to a low global change.

A major consequence of these results is that the genetic profile of a single tissue collected at one time point should be used with caution as a faithful portrait of other tissues from the same subject or the same tissue throughout life. Thus, the design of studies in human genetics interrogating a single sample per subject or applying lymphoblastoid cell lines may come into question. Sporadic disorders are common in medicine. We wish to stress the non-heritable genetic variation as a potentially important factor behind the development of sporadic diseases. Moreover, associations between post-zygotic mutations, clonal cell expansions and their relation to cancer predisposition are central in this context. Post-zygotic mutations are amenable to robust examination and are likely to explain a sizable part of non-heritable disease causality, which has routinely been thought of as synonymous with environmental factors. In view of the widespread accumulation of genetic aberrations with age and strong predictions of disease risk from such analyses, studies of post-zygotic mutations may be a fruitful approach for delineation of variants that are causative for common human disorders.", "doi": "10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-101322", "pmid": "23172682", "labels": {"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "jmedgenet-2012-101322"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC3534255"}], "verified": true, "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5c5adba54ca245a89e135b8b6bb343d7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications.scilifelab.se/publication/5c5adba54ca245a89e135b8b6bb343d7"}}}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bc889656aee749f4b8890968a40491f7", "title": "First Genome Sequence of a Syntrophic Acetate-Oxidizing Bacterium, Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans Strain Re1.", "authors": [{"family": "Manzoor", "given": "Shahid", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bongcam-Rudloff", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Schn\u00fcrer", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "M\u00fcller", "given": "Bettina", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2013-01-00", "journal": {"volume": "1", "issn": "2169-8287", "issue": "1", "title": "Genome Announc"}, "abstract": "Syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) have been identified as key organisms for efficient biogas production from protein-rich materials.
