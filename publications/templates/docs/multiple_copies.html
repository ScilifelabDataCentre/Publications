<p>
  Multiple copies of a publication reference are, of course, bad news.
  The Publications system tries to avoid creating duplicates when performing
  fetch by checking for already loaded DOIs and PMIDs.
</p>
<p>
  However, duplicates may nevertheless be created by mistake, for
  example when adding a reference manually that in fact has already
  been added.
</p>
<p>
  A curator may view the
  <a href="/publications/duplicates"><strong>Duplicates page</strong></a>
  which uses a heuristic algorithm to identify possible duplicates.
</p>
<p>
  A curator has to edit and/or delete the duplicated entries by hand
  to remove the offending entry. Note that labels may have to be
  transferred from the publication that is to be deleted to the one
  that is to be kept. This may require admin privileges.
