<p>
  An xref is a reference to an external resource, most often a
  database entry. Ideally, it should be accessible on the web. The
  reference consists of two parts: The external database and the
  accession code for the entry in it.
</p>
<p>
  In those cases where the external database provides a URL template,
  the Publications system can be configured to allow the button in the
  interface to open a new browser tab for the database entry.
</p>
<p>
  There is currently also an optional free-text description field
  associated with an xref. This may be used for a brief
  characterization of the data available in the database entry.
</p>
<p>
  The procedure to add xrefs to a publication is described in Add
  dataset xrefs.
