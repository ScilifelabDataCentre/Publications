<p>
  A subset of publications may be obtained by executing a selection
  expression in the <a href="/subset"><strong>Subset</strong></a> page.
</p>
<p>
  The selection expression works by using functions which select a subset of all
  publications currently in the system. Operators can be used to combine
  these subsets. Paranthesis are used to determine the order of evaluation
  if the operators. A selection expression may be arbitrarily complex.
</p>
<p>
  The list of selected publications can be viewed or downloaded in different
  file formats.
