<h3>Log in to your account</h3>

<p>
  In order to add publications to this system, you have to be logged
  in to your account in the system. If you do not have one, request
  it by contacting the system administrator given in
  the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Add publications by fetching data</h3>

<p>
  <strong>This is the recommended procedure for adding publications.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Publication references should be added using the
  <a href="/fetch" target="fetch"><strong>Fetch data for publication page</strong></a>.
  In that page, do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Enter the Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and/or PubMed
  identifiers (PMID) of the publications to be added.
</li>
<li>
  Use the checkboxes to denote which
  {% module Translate('labels') %} should be applied to the publications.
  {% if settings['SITE_LABEL_QUALIFIERS'] %}
  Also select the applicable qualifier.
  {% end %}
</li>
<li>
  When clicking "Fetch", the system goes to the web services at
  <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> and/or
  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>, respectively,
  to fetch the publication reference data.
</li>
<li>
  This procedure checks whether the DOI or PMID already exists in the
  database, in order to avoid multiple copies. The {% module Translate('labels') %}
  {% if settings['SITE_LABEL_QUALIFIERS'] %}
  and qualifiers
  {% end %}
  will be applied to entries that already exist in the database, as if they had
  been added by the operation.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Add publications manually</h3>

<p>
  Publication references can be added manually by filling in a
  form on the <a href="/add"><strong>Add publication manually page</strong></a>.
  This is for publication that has neither a DOI nor a PMID,
  often preprints.
</p>

<h3>Edit a publication</h3>

<p>
  It is possible to edit the details of a publication. However, this is
  <strong>strongly discouraged</strong>. It is much more preferable to
  update contents from PubMed or Crossref.
</p>
<p>
  If a publication as been wrongly marked using a {% module Translate('label') %}
  that you control, then <strong>do not delete the publication</strong>. Instead,
  edit the publication to remove the offending {% module Translate('label') %}.
</p>

<h3>Delete a publication</h3>

<p>
  A curator may delete any publication. Please note that this is
  a <strong>global</strong> operation, affecting the entire database.
</p>
<p>
  This should therefore be done <strong>only</strong> if the
  publication is clearly irrelevant for the site as a whole, or if it
  is a duplicate.
