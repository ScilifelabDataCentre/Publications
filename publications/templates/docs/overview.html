<p>
  The Publications system stores references to publications. It does
  not store PDFs of publications.
</p>
<p>
  The Publications system is appropriate for keeping track of the
  publications for a group, a project, an institute, a department, or
  similar.
</p>
<p>
  A publication reference ('publication' in short) may contain:
  <ul>
    <li>Title.</li>
    <li>Author by name and with ORCID reference, if available.</li>
    <li>Abstract.</li>
    <li>Bibliographic data; publication date, volume, pages, etc.</li>
    <li>References to external database entries (xrefs).</li>
    <li>Labels; annotation added by the curators.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Publications are added by providing DOIs or PMIDs (PubMed
  identifiers) which the Publications system then fetches the data for
  from the Crossref and/or PubMed web services.
