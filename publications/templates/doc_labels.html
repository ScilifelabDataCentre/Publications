<p>
  Labels are annotation tagged on to the publication references. They
  can be used to denote <i>e.g.</i> which facility unit or research
  group was involved in a publication, or what area the publication is
  in. The set of labels are controlled by the site admin.
</p>
<p>
  A curator account can have privileges for a set of labels. This
  means that she can add or remove those labels to a publication. She
  cannot change the labels for which she does not have privileges.
</p>

<h3>Qualifiers</h3>
<p>
  Labels may have qualifiers, which can be used to denote <i>e.g.</i>
  what type of involvement a facility unit had with the publication.
  The available qualifiers are part of the configuration of a site
  and cannot be changed via the web interface.
